Fish's Plaice.~
As you enter this haze filled room, your body is engulfed in a strange
yet pleasantly soothing sensation, as you inhale the strange smoke.
Slowly the walls melt away, and you find yourself floating in a
translucent blue underwater world, teeming with schools of fish.  There
is a large wooden shipwreck below you on the ocean floor, lost under a
carpet of aquatic vegetation, and illuminated magically by the golden
light filtering down from the surface above.  The whole seabed seems to
sway gently, as the current moves through the layers of plant life that
have taken root, and are home to a vast array of strangely shaped and
coloured creatures.

unusually luxurious.  A small well built fire is sitting on the fireplace but

Dangerous looking cliffs.~
You have moved down a little, when suddenly the rocks underneath your           
feet gives way. You bolt downwards, and your chin smashes against the           
jagged rock, knocking your head backwards. As you feel conciousness ebb         away, you can see the rocks below, racing toward you.                           
You remain concious just long enough to hit the rocks....
