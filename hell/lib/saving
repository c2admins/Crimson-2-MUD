"SAVING THROWS"
Saving Throws are measures of a character's resistance to special types of 
attacks such as poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind
of the character.  The chance to save is based on the character's level and 
class.  Saving Throws are classified into five categories of priority: 
1) Paralyzation, Poison, or Death Magic  
2) Rod, Staff, or Wand 
3) Petrification or Polymorph  
4) Breath Weapon  
5) Spell.

Example:
Gnarl is struck by the ray of a Wand of Paralyzation.  A save vs. wands and a 
save vs. paralyzation would both be appropriate.  However, since save vs. 
paralyzation is a higher priorty than save vs. wand, Gnarl must save vs. 
paralyzation.
