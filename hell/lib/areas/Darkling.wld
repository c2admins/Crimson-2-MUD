&WLight &nand &KShade&n~

You step into a land cloaked in shadow and intrigue.  The canopy blankets the land
in darkness and sorrow.  The only light seems to be from intermittent torches and occasional
brief bursts of light from above the trees.
This is the land of darklings, known as Dark Shadows.  May your visit be interesting,
challenging and, of course, memorable.

A well-kept trail leads you through the darkling camp.  You smell the musky smoke from the
small fires that dot the campsite.  Darklings seem to move with the shadow of the clouds
and trees.  You look around you and notice that the area has been divided, almost as if
the darklings allocated themselves along clan lines....Interesting.  Let's investigate.

The Red Darklings are accomplished thieves.  They have survived the centuries through fast
action, supreme dexterity, and the ability to think quickly.  They specialize in piercing
attacks, and are remarkably agile.  Careful when dealing with the "Reds" - they tend to
gain the upperhand quickly.

The Blue Darklings are skilled warriors, and are known throughout the lands for their strength
and their endurance.  Adept at most slashing weapons, the "Blues" believe that the best style
of fighting is fast, harsh and unrelenting.  They like blood, and aren't afraid to shed some of
their own in the process.

The Green Darklings are strong brutes who are quite handy with bludgeoning weapons.  If they
can't pound your brains out, well, you'd be a unique visitor to their encampment.  Hammers,
clubs, trees...heck, they'd pick up a building to smash you (if the buildings were small
enough to grasp).  Careful what you say here.  They pound first, pound second, and then ask
if you want another pounding.

you see a handful of Blue Darklings roaming their territory.  If you didn't know better,
you'd think they were unhappy to have you as a guest.  Go give one a hug.

The Blue Darklings are fierce warriors, there is no doubt.  For any unsuspecting mortal,
they can prove to be quite an adversary.  Yet they learned their skills and their abilities
from one Darkling, Hex.  He is known for being quite unlucky...for his enemies.  You see
his room to the south.  Will you enter?

Hex is a scarred, ragged monster of a darkling.  His rage has laid waste to the animal
population that had once inhabited these woods.  His training exercises have left weaker
Blue snotlings crippled or dead.  Only the strong survive, and Hex is determined to be
the strongest - no matter what.

The Green Darklings are strong creatures with a huge interest in nature.  They spend much
of their time planting and plowing, giving them great strength and endurance.  Though they
have interests in some of the simpler things in life, and enjoy walking through this orchard,
they are very brutal and simple-minded.  They hold no joy in the lives of animals, but will
protect their lands at all costs.

The Green darklings cultivate fruits, vegetables and shrubberies to make their territory

and the grass looks soft and pleasant.  The darklings you see around you look simple-minded
and dormant.  Careful that you do not anger them.

willing to help you relieve any of your tremendous burden.  This bazaar, their own little
market place, is a good area to find, and lose, some possessions.  Enjoy!

draw of all darkling thieves.  His skill is legendary, and his ability to twist situations
to fit his schemes served him well in the great color schism.
Beware.

The plowing grounds continue further south, and you see small melon plants and other various
crops growing out of the rich, cultivated soil.  You smell turned earth and can tell that
the ground and the land all around are well cared for and loved.  This gives you more of an
idea of who these Darklings are...  How odd that a race so inclined towards darkness would
care for items that require sunshine.

it to see if it is as good as it looks, but you hear the darkling plowmen approaching and you
wisely decide not to piss them off.

The Blue Darklings have their training levels, of course.  The savage survive, the "mildly
pissed off" are weeded out.  You must be strong.  You must be cruel.  You must be cold and
soulless.  You must be willing to destroy...and be destroyed.  Here, the character of the
future warriors will be determined.

the misses.  Who knows?  You might also find your coin collection that you thought you
lost when you were only 9 years old.  Take a look, hang around, see what you can see.

tend to bring their junk here and drop it. That's the nice thing about dumps.  You drop
stuff in them, and you don't have to worry about the junk anymore.

few shelves of books and two shoddy wooden tables.  And to the north there is a closed oak
door.  Curiouser and curiouser.

become refreshed from the cold, clear fluid.  You note with approval that the land around
the pond is lush and green.  It is nice to find such peace in a land seemingly filled with
conflict and unease.  If only life was as tranquil as the water.
