mob Justin tree palm~
Justin Tree~
A tree with palm shaped leaves looms over you.
~
   There are many kinds of trees in Xanth, a number of them vital to the
economy.  Beerbarrel trees are tapped for drink, oilbarrel trees are for
fuel.  But this tree is special.  A species never sprouted from seed.  Its
leaves are shaped like flat hands, and its trunk is the hue of tanned
human flesh.
   All is not right with this tree.  There are cut marks on the tree's roots.
The white wood wounds are clearley visible in contrast to the shoelike bark.
Driblets of reddish sap are forming, very much like blood.
