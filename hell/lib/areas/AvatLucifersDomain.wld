The Floating Chapel~
This chapel rests high above the clouds.  It is rarely used and very well kept
You see before you the most holiest of statues.  Many of them represent the
gods and godesses the live among these brilliantly lit skies.  All around you
you here the sounds of a chorus ringing through walls, floor, and pews.  This
chapel has married only the holiest of people. Now you are among them.

South of Heaven~
This is the place where only the greatest of all mortals may venture.  This
area is filled with emptiness in a land of depression and sorrow.  As you
look into the earth below you have a feeling of uneasiness and fear.  Only
by venturing forward can you achieve greatness and hope for a new world to
come to the land crimson.

Entrance to the Dark Castle~
You are now facing a tough and frightful choice.  You are at the entrance to
the evil castle.  You can either turn and run or face the most evil creatures
unknown to man.  The world has just gone totally black and there is a force
driving you forth.  The inscriptions on the door suggest this a very satanic
and very depressing place.  Maybe your feelings will change within the castle.
Or maybe you will just die.

There seems to be four different paths from here. To the north the hallways
seem to get darker.  To the south is the entrance of the castle.  To the east
you can hear screams of pain.  To the west the hallway seems to get brighter.

To the north you see a beautiful entranceway. To the east you see a very dark

present is the light from the candles that surround you and the cauldron at
the northern end of this room.  This room is huge in sheer size.  The walls
are covered in various symbols and many pentagrams.  There is a Highpriestess
here protecting what her master has given her.  So it may be best you leave
before she sacrifices your soul to her master.

screams are even human.  Your ears rings with the sounds from all around
and your feet start to tremble.  You must try to make it to the next room.

The pit of Depression.~
This room is so full of pain and agony.  You feel as thogh you not go on 
any longer.  You feel all that you have done means nothing to you or anyone
else.  The thought of death seems to invite you and the feelings of pain are
driving you to those ways.  You feel that life isn't what you felt along time
ago.  All that drives you to this place seems to haunt your thoughts.  You
can't feel much but sorrow and anger.  You try to hold on longer and you start
to feel like it will get much better.  But you then realize that nothing 
ever gets better as long as you have lived on this planet.  You burst into
tears as the thoughts of suicide race through your head and you start to 
think of all the ways you can end it all.  The feelings that some one 
somewhere will miss you when you are gone.  The tourment blinds your rational
train of thought as you start to cower in the corner and you feel chills of
unrealistic cold.  The powers that lead you here only discourage your own 
existance are now the only things that you can think about. When you try to
regain your normal thought process your are hit with blinding feelings of
hatered and sorrow.  Now you start to think of happier times, but they soon
get clouded out by times that you have felt this way before.  As you persist
in trying to block out those feelings you fall to the floor and agonizing 
flashes of tears.

warnings of whats to continue ahead.  Go forth is you have great bravery.

A dark pathway in the trees.~
The forest here seems to turn cold.  There doesn't seem to be any sounds
comming from anywhere.  The trees here seem to be wilting over, and the grass
seems to be browning.  All around you is nothing but a dead forest.  There
seems to be a dark path leading foward to the north.  To the south is more
forest.

On a hidden trail.~
There seems to be a trail made in the surface of the grass.  As if someone
or something had worn a trail to the north and south.  There is very little
light here, as it only comes from the reddish moon above.  The trail goes
further to the north and south.

Dead-end trail~
You seem to have hit the end of this trail.  There just seems no going on to
the north, as it is blocked by moss and trees.  As you look closely at the
trees however you notice there is a path in over the stumps, on top of the
hill.

Wrath~
This room is filled with pictures of torment and hatred.  You can see there
is alot of rage in the world.  Some of these people were as infamous in life
as their memories are in death.  Many creatures have succumbed to this sin.
Their anger towards others has caused death in many cases.  In others has
tormented their minds forever.  You can see there is broken bone and flesh
laying about this room.  This room is one of the easiest to end up in.

Envy~
This room has images of those who have aspired to be someone else.  You can
see they have already lead a life of torment and disruption questing to be
someone they're not.  The room is filled with cold and dapper.  There is a
foul stench of despair here.  These lost souls will have no one to envy
here.  They are forever encased in this black room forever.

Pride~
There is a foul stench of ego in this room.  This room is filled with many
faces of beauty.  Many faces of fame.  Many faces of fortune.  However, all
thats here is shame.  The ugliest people in the world are ones filled with
vanity.  Filled with self-righteousness, these people are damned to be
placed within the confines of their images.  Their stature means nothing in
a group of themselves.  No one will ever tell them how beautiful they are.
No one will ever tell them how much they admire them.  No one will ever tell
them anything again.

Lust~
This is by far the hardest sin to resist.  This place is covered equally by
men and women.  You can see that the images on the walls are tiny.  There are
various types of people attached to this sin.  Pedophiles, rapists, and even
people you just thought were normal are encrusted upon these walls.  Their
images burned forever in these halls.  Most of these people have no idea
what love is.  You can see there are a lot of tortured souls here.  The
floors are covered in vasoline and bondage gear.

You can see these walls are lined mainly with men.  Very few women are in
the images on the walls.  This room has a foul stench.  It is the smell of
the unbathed and unclean souls who have spent their lives having everyone
else work for them.  You can tell that this place could use a good bar of
soap.

this place in some form or another.  There are a plethora of kings and nobles
past and present here.  The future will make these images shrink.  Only time
time will tell if you end up as an image on this wall.  There is gold and
other valuable trinkets lining the floor.  This is one of the more single
colored rooms in these halls.  All of it is gold.

This is the first of many rooms of sin.  You can see that there are seven of
these rooms.  You will have to fend off all of them.  Sin is a deadly thing
to fight.  Most go through life living in it.  In this world you cannot live
with it.  It will consume you quickly.  This is the room of gluttony.  This
is where those who spent their lives trying to torture themselves have
come.  Those who love pain line the walls in the form of an image.  This
room is not as covered as the rest.  However, many have lived in this place.

The these dead bushes are filled with thorns and poisonous snakes.  You can see
there are many skeletal remains of humans and other creatures that mistakenly
walked through here.  This trail has been blocked off by the minions of Lucifer
himself.  They are made to conceal the location of his Fear Factory.

This area provides no cover, no help, and no mercy.  You can see by the 
landscape; all you will find is pain.  No guide would ever venture on this 
journey.  No sane man would make this trip.  God hears no cries out in Lucifers
Domain.  This trip will take any creature to their limits.  There is no quick 
way out.  You teleportation fails in this thick brush.  The only chance you have
is running back.

Relative Ash~
You are standing outside of a man-made steel cave.  Inside you will know the
true meaning of the word fear.  The master of this dominion has employed 
mankinds worst creator of fear.  The bastard who creates mechanical beasts of
destruction, also created half of hells biological army.  The ground you stand
upon has been given the name "Relative Ash" because of the empty corpses that
have been laid to waste and dropped here.  The creatorleaves what he will not use.

quite thick and sturdy.  There seems to be almost no light comming from
inside, except the sparks that flash deep into the bowells of this cave.  This
structure has been called in legend as the "Fear Factory".

He is a creature of the darkest soul.  Almost pure evil, this man has said
to have been earth's most torid soul.  He is a blood thirsty menace.
The cave is dark and filled with a nasty stench.  You will feel why they call
it the Fear Factory.

This is a cold dank cellar of sorts.  The wicked have come here to breed and
to kill.  The monsters created down here are a very sorted blend of creatures.
The master builder uses spare parts and lost souls to make these beasts.  Some
are made of skin and others of metals.  All are driven mad by their torment.

to this for eternity.  They have all lost their minds and lost their souls to
the dark one.  The martyrs here are from earth.  They violated the suicide 
clause in the bible contract.  They led good lives, yet finished it off by 
offing themselves, or allowing others to kill them.
