mob time~
time~
Time passes slowly by.
~
Time very much resembles the Grim Reaper of lore.  Its cloaked body and face 
make its features indistinguishable, leaving time's appearance to your 
imagination.  Time has a different face for each person who looks upon it so
no two descriptions will ever be the same.

The air in front of you is blurred as a deafening scream reaches you.

refuse to be confused as there is no obvious light source within the stone and no

and left to dwell here in the circle of stones for all eternity.
