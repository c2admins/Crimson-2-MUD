mob Medved hunter water~
a medved~
A medved hovers over the water, looking for prey.
~
A medved looks calculatingly back at you, trying to determine your edible
value.  This species, once a league of hunters in all niches, has been destroyed
until they exist only rarely where they are surrounded and protected by magic.
It reaches for you timidly with its hand as it hovers above the surface of the
earth.

mob caeba~
a caeba~
A caeba floats along the surface of the water.
~
The long, straight body of this grey caeba is covered with long, air-filled
fibers which repel the water as it moves freely on the surface.  Legend holds
that the caeba is a timid creature which spends its life cycle with as little
contact with other species as possible and defends itself by means of ferocious
acid breath which comes from the two tubes on each side of its head.

mob alata plated serpent~
Alata~
Alata, the plated water serpent, floats toward you.
~
The great, mystical Alata is covered with square plates much like armor.  This
beast, though generally placid, is known to spit burning acid upon enemies
that rile its anger.  The beast's serpentine body moves easily through the
water propelled by the series of legs on either side of its body with claws that
could tear you to shreds.

mob shorea spinning orange~
a shorea~
An orange shorea is spinning here.
~
The shorea is an odd beast of watery environs that spins through the air on
three awkwardly placed wings.  Seeing these ugly orange beasts in flight not
only makes the flight of the bumblebee seem possible, but also makes it seem
a simple and graceful process.  If I were you, I'd protect myself.  There's
no telling which way this beast will spin next.

a blue chirita~
A square, blue chirit spreads itself over the water.
~
It is not clear at a glance whether the soft, blue chirita is a plant or an
animal.  Since you haven't the time to delve into the scientific aspects of this
question, you just hazard your best guess and wonder what use this little 
square of fuzzy blue something might be.

mob mangrove roots~
a mangrove root~
The dangerous mangrove roots protrude from the water.
~
Your initial fears that you could break a leg in this mess of roots is over-
shadowed as you remember the enchanted pond around you.  These roots could be
anything because of those enchantments so you watch your step very carefully 
in hopes that, if they are enchanted in some way, they will take no notice of
you.

mob lily carnivorous water~
a carnivorous water lily~
A carnivorous water lily digests its latest meal here.
~
The beautiful yet treacherous water lily floats peacefully, only ingesting a 
new meal very rarely.  These particular lilies were once known far and wide for
the healing properties of their extracts as well as their rare and fragile
beauty.  This outward fragility is, as you may learn, quite a deception.

A large, protective dragon fly hovers here.
~
These great bodied dragon flies have taken over the task of protecting the
beasts on the surface of the pond and they take this task quite seriously.  Take
care that they do not catch you trying to hurt any of their innocent friends.

a cladoceran~
You gape at this rolypoly cladoceran moving through the water.
~
These poor stupid beasts can function no more intelligently than to roll 
around bumping into walls and occasionally ingest some food.  Though they have
mush for brains, they have magnificent reflexes and don't particularly enjoy
pain.  This animals rounded and compact body makes it difficult to hit, but
how could the beast possibly defend itself?

a grey copepod~
A grey copepod propels itself through the water.
~
The long cylindrical body of this creature has a fin on each side of its body
which, upon closer examination, is actually a large and very strong flagella.
This copepod is quite obviously a strong animal and a worthy opponent if you
dare risk its ire.

A dragonfly nymph clings to the floor.

This massive bug is nothing like the average nymph.  These must be the younger
versions of the great dragonfly guards from above.  They don't look overly 
exciting but you can't quite squash them under your lovely foot.

a thismia~
A thismia imitates tangled roots here.
~
The thismia were long a confusing breed of animal for the sim ple fact that they
appear to be a jumble of plant roots lying exposed.  They are, however, 
definately animals though this is only clear at night when they voraciously
hunt down their meals.

mob schima~
a schima~
A grotesque schima moans out its misery.
~
The last of an understandably dying breed, this schima can do little but wander
around mourning its fate.  The disgusting beast has a tiny head with one eye and
the location of its brain (if it has one) is anybody's best guess.  Perhaps
it is split up in the four huge arms extending from the twig of a body or 
perhaps not.  Maybe you should chop it up and find out, eh?

mob renda~
Renda~
Renda inches its way across the floor of the pond.
~
Renda is a squat, confusing animal.  Its waxy cuticle makes it impossible to 
figure out which end is which.  The best thing to do would probably be to hack
away at both until the Renda gets ticked off and fights back (which shouldn't
take too long) or simply live with the mystery and forget Renda.

The arundina is the spirit of a beautiful woman drowned long ago.  Her spirit
dwells here and expresses itself in the form of this disembodied head
with her long, beautiful mane of hair flowing all around her.  Take
care that you do not disturb her as she does not like to be distracted
from her absorptive self pity.
