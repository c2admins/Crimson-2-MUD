mob bug~
the computer bug~
A little, hairy computer bug is here, trying to mess things up.
~
It is one of those irritating little creatures that like to infect innocent
and defenceless programs, trying to make them act weird.  Programmers spend
countless hours trying to eliminate them, but they are indeed very hardy.
DikuMUD is known to be one of their favourite habitats.

mob isha elf~
Isha the Dark Elf~
Isha the Dark Elf is here, observing you silently.
~
She is no less than beautiful, skin as dark as the night and hair shining like
silver in the moonlight.  Her slender body is adorned with a sleeveless shirt
and a short skirt made from black scales joined with silver threads.  Her back
is covered by a large, hooded cloak as black as her skin and in her broad
silver belt hangs a long, slender sword in a silver scabbard.
