Jhersa, evil borne of innocence is here
~
This young child looks sweet and innocent lying in this crib.  You ponder
the evil eminating from this place and wonder at the innocence of a child.
Jhersa is the spawn of two of the archfiends.  She was made out of evil and
a small part of good.  She is clutching something in her grasp and while she
sleeps, an evil grin takes over the inncocent face and you venture to guess
the working in the mind of the infantile leader of the Archfiends of Zalmynk.
