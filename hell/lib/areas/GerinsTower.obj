The several pages that comprise the treastise talk about the idiosyncracies
of Vampire Immortality.  It discusses the endless need for victims blood to
stay alive, or to stay immortal.  It seems that some spirit, or essence is
contained within the vampire blood which gives vampires immortality, but also
makes them need others' blood.

I am at a loss...I have tried for so long...and now I feel sick for the
crimes I have committed as I knew I would...There must be a way...I must live
on forever!...but I have not found it...
My vampire friend Nezryn knows not how his own powers work!...and yet evil
experiments we did to find out...That path of my life was dark...dismal...yet
it is as easy to be evil as you can imagine...simply dont care...its easy
if you are mad that is...and thats what I must be...Immortality! hah!
It is the joke of my life...my death...I cannot die!...I cannot die!...I will
not die!...
I shall wait...wait...until...until I find the way...strange that I can be
immortal, but I cannot live my life while my body lives...cryogenics...not
immortality...at least not my definition...

And these are my crimes, which ironically, if I find immortality, I will
never have to repent for:
The winners of my contest, the bravest of the brave, the strongest of the
strong, the wisest of the wise, they get there winnings and other prizes
and live there life to the fullest...but come 10 months later...they are dead.
I have killed them...There are too many to list...
They die so that I might live...the vampire way...
Yet I have decided to end that way...in search for true immortality, the kind
that does not live off of others...One month per victim of extra life is not
good...I need more...
So this is why I must wait...

God forgive me for Desdemona...the experiment gone wrong...
I can no longer live with myself...yet I will not allow myself to die...
the chamber is almost complete...and in it I will rest...
my freeze chamber...the cold oblivion of peace...
Forgive me Desdemona...your body lives on, but your mind is gone...
I, Gerin, do confess...sometimes I wonder if I am myself...
What would my friend Phisher say...he lives in my waters...
He would say die...die Gerin...

for him...having to feed every day.  He is convinced there is a better way.
A way that will make him like a God...thats what he wants...So if he can
become a God I will surely follow...otherwise...well...lets say I haven't
made up my mind just yet...
