NW Arena~
You are standing in the northwest corner of the Arena. A great sence of good
will and life seems to fill the air around you and you feel that this would
be a good place for those good natured to make a stand.

N Arena~
You have made your way into the northern most point of the Arena. The air here
is heavy and it makes it hard for you to think. For some reason the words to
your magical spells come slowly to your mind and their meaning unclear.

NE Arena~
You are standing in the northeast corner of the Arena. A choking darkness so
thick you can almost cut it surrounds you. Flashes of gruesome images appear
before your eyes and dark thoughts enter your mind. The stench of evil is
strong here, the perfect place for those known to be less than honorable.

W Arena~
You have arrived in the western end of the Arena. The sounds of fighting fill
your ears and you find yourself pausing for a second. It is then that you notice
your magical aura being slowly eaten away. A trap for those magicaly inclined!

Arena Center~
Welcome to the Arena Of Death. In this area you can kill others without the
worry of getting a PKILLER flag or without loosing fate with the gods. Those
that have however an "unsteady" relationship with lady luck as we speak shall
be warned that they enter here at their own risk. Rules on PKILLING still
apply here however.

NOTE!: the Arena has been changed, it is now much more deadly that before,
so look out and beware, and most of all..........Have a nice day :)

E Arena~
AMAZING! You did not notice it before, in fact you did not notice it until
you entered the room, but for some reason the eastern section of the Arena
is totally filled with water! You find yourself having trouble moving about
in the water, your movements are slow and you need to swim, but worst of all
is you are running out of air!

SW Arena~
The southwest part of the arena seems to be a great deal smaller than the rest
of the arena. In fact you guess that you would have trouble fitting more than
two people in this particular room at once, especially if those two people 
were fighting.

S Arena~
This is the southern most point of the Arena. A puzzling feeling comes over 
you as you stand here. You find yourself wondering what side of the eternal
battle between good and evil you should belong to, you feel you should make
up your mind and fast, for this is no place for those that do not know what
they want.

SE Arena~
*ZAP* The static air of the southeast end of the Arena makes contact with your
skin causing you to yelp in pain. Will the madness of this cursed Arena never
end! You rub your pained chest and wonder why you are unable to hear anything.

Arena Pit~
You tumble into a large pit that is suspended below the Arena. This area is
huge and from down here you are able to see the whole of the upper arena. There
seems to be no way out of this particular area, until you notice the long pole
running upwards in the very centre of the Arena.
