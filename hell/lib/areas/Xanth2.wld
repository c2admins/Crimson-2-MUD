&KWo&rnd&Ker &rL&Kan&rd&n~

&wThe mistress of this domain is the beautiful queen of &rhell&w.  Her power lies in seduction and the
&wpromise of eternal youth.  Her weakness comes from her strength, drawn from the veins of those who 
&wcatch her fancy.  To feel her bite is &Cheaven&w.  To endure her curse is &rhell&w.  If you are her guest
&w then you are welcome.  If you are an intruder... be on your &rguard&w.

&wSo... where is &RAlice&w?  She rarely leaves her &WW&Ro&Wn&Rd&We&Rr&Wl&Ra&Wn&Rd&w.&n
