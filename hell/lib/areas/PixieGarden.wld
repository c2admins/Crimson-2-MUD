Indigenous Gardens~
You wander aimlessly through plants indigenous to the area.  The limbs of many
trees dangle into the path, not allowing you to see too far ahead.  The bushes
and leaves all around you buzz with activity and energy, some occupied with
more than the wind.

the numerous windows running all around the house.  There is a small cauldron
hanging over the fire and the place is cozy and warm, making the bed in the

Fungus Cellar~
The contrast from the light levels above to the darkness here blinds you for a
moment.  As your eyes begin to adjust, you see what you have already felt.  The
humidity down here makes sweat pour down your face and gives life to the
thousands of mushrooms growing from piles of feces on tables all around the 
room.  The only things more stifling than the humidity and the stench are the
glares of the mushrooms themselves as you let the light of day in to 
disturb their peace with the darkness.

in trellises down each of the sides without exits.  There is a ladder leading up
to the top of the gazebo before you and you can see the shaded path to the 
indigenous gardens to the west, a statue-lined promenade to the east, and
a path down to the fountain to the south.

with your eyes from the large, ornate fountain as far as the edge where it
narrows into a river and goes down roughly fifty feet in a waterfall.  This
is the resting place of Cuka, the guardian of these gardens.  She protects
them at all times, assuring no picking of the flowers or walking the paths
after hours.

period.  The graceful sculptures line the path, dappled with sunshine in the
pattern of the leaves lightly interwoven overhead.  All exhibit the same natural
grace, but some let you see the physical power or mental power of an individual
pixie hero.  Each has its own character and a definite place in the scheme of
these elegant gardens.  The path continues to the east and leads into the gazebo

shattered shell still down there through the mist?

and quite simple since it's so dark and damp down here.  Tropomyn seems to be a 
pixie of the night as he stays down here all day and does his upkeep work after
the sun has gone down and the gardens are closed.  There are no sources of light
and it is quite chilly and damp due to the lake above.

In a Secluded Alcove~
In the shade of the trees, there sits a bench which is the perfect size for two.
You feel safe here from the world outside and would be happy to sit here with
your love for hours on end, the tips of leaves and your lover's fingers gently
brushing your neck, shoulders, and head.  The gentle sighing of the trees sets
the scene for your seduction.

Upon the Rocks~
You realize as you step over the edge how foolish you were to listen to the
summons of the rocks below you.  You feel your own body broken to pieces as you
bounce not quite so merrily down the cliff to a final crash below, finding 
yourself beside the corpse of Anyana's lover and no better off than he.  The
pity is, will anyone mourn your death as Anyana mourns his?

By the Fungus Cellar~
This dark, damp room leads to the fungus cellar.  The world goes on above you
and the world of the fungus is to your east.
