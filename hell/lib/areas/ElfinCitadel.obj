Long ago, an ancient evil attacked the citadel.  An evil so powerful that it could never be destroyed entirely.
The king, in a valiant attempt to save his people and home, called forth the powers of the elven god Solarius.
The battle between the god Solarius and the evil one was furious, but in the end the elven god stood
triumphant over the corpse of his enemy.

Solarius, knowing that the evil could never be destroyed, instead sealed the already regenerating spirit inside
a holy altar deep under the citadel. The creatures blade, an artifact of great power, was broken into three 
pieces and given to three guardians to prevent it from ever being reunited again. He then created three books,
the books of swords, to serve as a reminder to his people of the evil that lurked below them, and to act as a
greater barrier to prevent the stormblade from again falling into evil hands.

Even so, the blade can be remade. Solarius' power was great, but not all-powerful. Many have attempted to 
collect the broken sword pieces and books, and bring them to the altar to be mended, but so far the elves have
thwarted all attempts. If one were to &Wassemble&B the stormblade at the altar, it could well spell doom for
all creatures of good......&n
