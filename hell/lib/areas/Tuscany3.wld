Chamber of the Weapons Master~
This fabulous chamber is immaculate.  There isn't a drop of blood, sweat
nor even a single chip or flaw anywhere.  There are weapons lining each wall
as well as a few hanging from the ceiling.  There are several practicing
devices throughout the room and they all look like they have been used A LOT.
There is a bookshelf with several books about weapons in it.  There are also
several ceremonial weapons of varying materials, in special cases about the
chamber.

Top of the Silver Staircase~
You are standing atop another in the seemingly endless stream of metal
stairwells. This one shines of bright, freshly-polished silver.  It
is decorated with statues of monks, cavaliers, and bards.  It seems to be
a bit longer than the others also.  There is a hall to the north.

Chamber of the Cavalier Lord~
This is by far the most highly decorated chamber in the entire tower.
Against the north wall there are two suits of black glowing full platemail,
each grasping a longsword in one hand and holding a shield, decorated with
the Lord's coat of arms, in the other.  Against the eastern wall can be
seen several framed parchments, with such names as Telgar the Ranger Lord,
Peacock the Hierophant Druid, King Drenor of Tuscany, Meloncholy (Archmage
to His Magesty), and many more signed upon them.  Against the western wall
there are various gold-plated weapons, all with plaques beneath them with
the name of the foe vanquished for the weapon.  There are three stuffed
dragon heads above these weapons as well, two of which are red dragons and
one gigantic head of an ancient black.  In the center of the room there are
statues of a Druid, a Blue Dragon, a Ranger Lord and the Cavalier Lord to
whom this chamber belongs.

Chamber of the Cavalier/Archmage~
You couldn't have entered a more dangerous chamber if you tried.  The
chamber looks like a giagantic laboratory, with instruments of magical
persuation everywhere.  There is a very large bookcase with literally
hundreds of books in it and none of them have names.  Against the western
wall there is a bright glow, coming from a gigantic tome resting on a
pedestal.

Top of the Topaz Staircase~
This staircase looks quite remarkable.  Carved entirely out of topaz it shines
brighter than any other you've seen so far.  There are several illusions
dancing about the room, which canstantly change form and appearance.  At one
point you see a heavily armored gentleman conversing with a god and at the
next moment you see him without any armor creating a swarm of meteors from
thin air.  The stairs go down from here and there is a lapis door to the
south and another to the west.

Top of the Pearl Staircase~
You are standing atop the beautiful pearl staircase.  The entire stairwell
glows and radiates a feeling of excessive magic.  The statues lining the walls
depict the most famous battles of the war with the forces of Hel.  The elven
warriors, mounted upon their magnificent griffons/ the powerful rangers
using the forces of the forest/ and the cavaliers with thier incredible
horses and armor.  Each statue is a unique original and any one of them
would cost half a dragon's horde to purchase.  They all glow with fairie
fires and to stare at them to long could easily distract you from your goal.

pon it.  The rider is dressed in full-plate and seems to be

capturing/training various mounts).  There is a small staircase in the

Entrance to the Halls of the Gods~
You have entered the halls of the gods.  Overwhelming power radiates
everywhere. There are no fancy decorations or anything around.  All
around you is a mist that strangely resembles dew, however, it is neither
wet nor does it impare your vision at all it is just sortof there.  The
air here is the freshest you've ever inhaled and an all-encompasing
feeling of something unnatural engulfes you.  A magical voice booms out
as you enter the halls: 'Ye who hath violated the Halls of the Gods, be
warned :  All whom are not invited shall be dealt with accordingly.  The
mythos of the Kalevala are NOT pleased.'
