mob lucifanticus luck dragon ancient wyrm~
The Ancient Wyrm of Luck, Lucifanticus~
Lucifanticus, the Ancient Luck Wyrm rests easily here.
~
This enormous beast has the eyes of a kitten.  He seems to look at
you as if waiting to receive a scratch.  Make no mistake though he
is one of the largest creatures you've ever seen.  The entire
roof of the tower is his lair.  From head to tip of tail you'd guess
him to be no shorter than one-hundred feet long.  His wings, although
tucked, appear as if they could block out the sun.  There is a
bright golden stripe down his back, starting at his neck.  His underbelly
is as white as ivory and you'd almost swear that his scales are made
of ivory.

Sir Ludwig Von Henrics, the Blue Knight~
Sir Ludwig Von Henrics, the Blue Knight ponders your significance.
~
Sir Ludwig Henrics is the lord of the Tuscan cavaliers.  He stands before you
as a very imposing sight.  He is over six feet tall with dark brown hair and
brown eyes which seem to gaze right through you to your very soul.  There are
many visible scars on his face and neck and the dents in the shield that he
prominently displays, are no doubt from many vicious battles.  His shield
displays his coat of arms upon which are several symbols that you do not
recognize. Sir Ludwig is often referred to as 'The Blue Knight,' a name
derived from his suit of full platemail which has been enchanted to glow
blue. You also notice that he seems to have a lot of mobility for someone
wearing full plate, as well as the fact that he moves without making a sound.

mob untamo god sleep~
Untamo, God of Sleep and Dreams~
A Finnish God stands here putting people to sleep.
~
Untamo is among the first rank of the Gods of RamsHorn, brother to Ukko, Ikka, Ahto, Hissi and Flamenhein. He
is a quiet, unprepossessing deity, little concerned in the politics or day to day lives of men. But he holds 
sway over the mind of mankind, in sleep and in darkness, and as such has great power.
The secrets than we all keep hidden from others, that we admit not even to ourselves, these are visible to
Untamo in the realm of dreams. He may send dreams of pleasure and inspiration, or portents of warning and 
nightmares of sweat drenching terror. The wrath of Untamo, rare as it is, can be a terrible thing, for to those 
so singled out, rest and sleep is denied. The mere act of closing one's eyes can bring on visions that freeze 
the soul, and those that do not kill themselves soon succumb to lack of sleep.

He never seems to be in one place, his body seems to move though
you are sure he is sitting perfectly still.  His cloak seems to
have a life of its own as well.  The greens of it seem to be a
smoke which moves about the purple fabric.

The son of ILMATAR, he spent 730 years in her womb and became so bored waiting to be born that he took matters 
into his own hands and crawled out. 
He discovered fire in the belly of a fish which was in the belly of a fish which was in the belly of a fish, 
and thus created the world's first three-course fish dinner. 
He also invented the world's first harp, using the bones of a gigantic pike and the hair of a maiden (who was 
presumably equally gigantic).

Kullervo, Hero of the Kalevala~
A mighty Finnish hero stands here.
~
In the Finnish Kalevala Kullervo was the ill-fated son of Kalervo. He is the only unredeemably tragic character 
in Finnish mythology.
His father died in a clash with his own brother Untamo, who sells Kullervo as a slave to Ilmarinen. Later 
Kullervo flees and finds that his family is still alive except for his sister who has disappeared. 
Kullervo's father sends him to pay the taxes and on the way back he seduces his sister without realising who
she is. Out of shame the sister commits suicide. Seeking revenge Kullervo kills Untamo and his family, only to
find his own family dead when he returns home. In the end Kullervo also commits suicide.
Kullervo proved inept and ignorant having not had a father to pass on knowledge and skills.
The death poem of Kullervo, where he (like Hamlet) interrogates his blade, is justly famous. Unlike the dagger 
in Hamlet, Kullervos sword replies, bursting into song affirming that if it gladly participated in his other 
foul deeds, it would gladly drink of his blood also.

The Divine Smith and Eternal Hammerer. 
He was the brother (or possibly just a good friend) of VAINAMOINEN, for whom he forged a SAMPO. This was a 
magic mill of amazing complexity which included the magic ingredients of a swan's quill tip, a barren cow's 
milk, a barley grain and the wool of one ewe. It was three-sided and could grind corn, money and salt, yet was 
easily portable. 
This gadget was supposed to buy a bride for VAINAMOINEN, but things didn't work out with the prosective in-laws 
and they snatched it back. During a chase it got lost at sea, but it still grinds out salt.

mob ilmatar goddess mothers~
Ilmatar, Goddess of Mothers~
The Goddess of Mothers watches over the nursery.
~
Goddess of Air and Creator of the world via Cosmic Egg cookery. 
In the beginning there was only ILMATAR, the void and a great deal of wind. ILMATAR, tired of counting 
rainbows and letting the wind play with her hair, began to long for a son.  
Her longing was so great that the East Wind itself took pity. She found herself buffeted and tossed by the 
wind's tempestuous love-making until, exhausted, she could bear it no longer and collapsed. And there inside 
her was conceived VAINAMOINEN, the child of the wind.  
Unfortunately he didn't seem inclined to make an appearance, and after seven centuries or so she began to 
give up hope of seeing him. Then one day she noticed a Celestial Eagle flying overhead. 
The poor bird was desperately pregnant and looking for somewhere to land. So ILMATAR helpfully raised her 
knee and the bird came swooping down. Half a dozen Cosmic Eggs were laid, followed by an egg made of iron. The 
bird then gathered them all up, sat upon them and went to sleep... 
And now ILMATAR was faced with a problem familiar to anyone with a household pet. How do you move without
waking them up? Her leg was aching, so she slowly, carefully, she began to stretch out her leg.. and slowly, 
inevitably, the seven eggs rolled off and fell majestically into the raging sea. 
No sooner had they touched the water than the shells cracked and a vast Cosmic Omelette was formed upon the 
waves. ILMATAR watched in amazement as the churning mixture solidified into Heaven and Earth. One yolk slipped 
into the sky to form PAIVA, the Sun, while the egg white became KUU, the glistening Moon. Stars were made from 
pieces of speckled eggshell, and thus the world was formed. 
ILMATAR was delighted with events, and busied herself shaping the lands and adding finnishing touches. And then 
she felt a stirring inside her. VAINAMOINEN had woken up after so many years and was eager to see the new 
world.

Surma is said to be the son of Tuoni and Tuonetar, and is depicted as a shrouded figure, with green eyes 
blazing in the shadow of his cowl. He is the youngest of the northern gods, but is said that even though he was 
a babe during the First Godswar he caused great evil. 
Surma is a trickster god that takes great pleasure in betraying trust and taking advantage of the greed and 
lust of humans. It is said that even his own parents try to ban him from the Underworld, but that he always 
finds a way to get there anyway. Hiisi rarely allows him in his court, and Guuron is said to want to kill him 
for following him around for years and bringing him ill-luck.

Hiisi is a bald man of great girth dressed in black. He is the leader of the Pohjolan faction of gods, and
is sometimes called Ukkos brother. Hiisi wants nothing more than to destroy the Kalevala and rule all realms

and truth of law as Ukko, but only to his benefit.

mob tuoni god underworld~
Tuoni, God of the Underworld~
The Lord of the Underworld readies his weapon.
~
Tuoni is the banned god. It was he who shouldered the blame for beginning the Second Godwar, and as 
punishment, Ukko banned him from granted powers or spells to any mortals. He spends his time scying on the 
mortal realm in his silver pool, and relives battles with the spirits of the dead. Tuonis anger and 
resentment is said to be greater than all the other gods of the Pohjola, hating them all except save for his 
wife, Tuonetar.
Tuoni is a tall man with ashen skin, dressed in black furs, and surrounded by a pack of hell hounds. It is 
said that when Tuoni leaves the Underworld to conquer the mortal realm, Ragnarok shall begin

separation through death causes lovers. Legends say that she may offer a lover an impossible task to 
accomplish in order to return his beloved to life but steals that soul as well when he fails. 
Tuonetar once shared the domain of death with her husband, but Tuonis power is now banned from the mortal 
world, and while revered he has no church.
