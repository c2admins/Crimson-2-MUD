Santa's House of Heros~
   As you walk in this roomyou notice that this does not belong to your
ordinary citizen of Midgaard.  The family shield of the Claus clan is 
displayed upon the north wall.   There are statues and paintings all over
this room immortalizing all of Midgaard's greatest heros.  Above the 
fireplace hangs perhaps the biggest painting you have ever seen.  The
painting is of 6 of the best warriors you have ever heard of: Santa,
Reddragon, Evil, Tommy, Grungy, and BlueDragon.  The painting shows these
warriors engaged in battle with the greatest enemies of Midgaard.

Justarius's House~
   You are in the home of Justarius the Magnificent.  The walls are all 
painted purple, red, and blue.  You sense a great deal of mana in this 
room, could it be because Justarius is a mage, and a powerful one at that,
of course.  In front os you there is a comfy looking bed and an over
stuffed chair.  Scattered all over the room are books and papers (Justarius
is a sloppy person) and an empty bookshelf to your right.

Nymph's House of Pleasure and Pain~
   You walk into a splendid building with a high arched ceiling and
and tiled marble floors.  Dwarfed in the middle of this collosal structure
is a small grove of trees.  As you approach the grove you hear water
splashing and children playing.  However the quality of laughter has such a 
rippling quality to it that you are enticed to come closer...and as you step
into the grove you see several woodland nymphs frolicking in the spring.
Most of them scatter when they see you.
A feeling of serenity surrounds you and you feel you could stay here 
forever.......

The Grand Pavilion~
You are in a large pavilion with plush pillows layering the floor.
A cool deser wind blows through, soothing and relaxing all within.
Exotic foods and objects are scattered everywhere.  Several catch
your eye..a jeweled tiara...a glittering veil...even a small idol of
the god Ben..everything..but the moment you try to touch anything it
slowly starts to fade away.  This is clearly a very complex illusion
created to put all who stay here at ease.  The beauty of this tent
mesmerises you; everything here is perfect.  A small piece of Paradise.
