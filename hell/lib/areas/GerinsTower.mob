Gromen~
Gromen, an apprentice to Gerin, glares at you.
~
Gromen is dressed in green robes trimmed with gold.  He is a stunning man,
very big, even bear-like in size.  He could have been a great warrior, or
perhaps he is a great warrior and just happens to be multi-talented.  Gromen
seems to be quite concerned that you are here.  The magical tower defenses
must have failed.

with a pin might kill him, you think.
