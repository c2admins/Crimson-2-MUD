The lazy hammock room.~
You step into a room designed for wasting away a beautiful summer's
afternoon.  A hammock designed for two is strung up between two large
palm trees, and the warm summer sun shines down to warm your skin.
A small pool of crystal blue water reflects the days sun, and awaits
to cool off bodies heated by the summer sun.

A dimly lit bedroom.~
A candle flickers from a tall calabera in the corner. The center
peice of this room is a large four poster bed. Lacey curtains drape
down from the sides, like fine mist. The floor is polished wood,
and a large rug lays infront of a small fireplace on the west wall.
The air is warm in here, not too warm, but warm enough that clothing
isnt needed. The bed is covered by a feathery quilt, and pillows lay
scattered around the room. A few small padded stools are stacked in 
the corner, and you wonder what could be kept in the cupboard
to your left. You decided to open it an have a look. The cupboard
goes far back, and inside it is a range of the finest french lingerie
in all differnt sizes, colors and styles. You wonder what is kept in
the bottom drawer, but it appears to be locked, with the key nowhere
to be found. A light breeze flows through the window, billowing the
curtains back, like a ghost. Looking out the window you see a sky
full of stars over a forest of tall trees. You wonder where this 
magical place exists, and you hope that you'll never have to leave.
