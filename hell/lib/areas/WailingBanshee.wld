  &cWhat once appeared to be a single ship can now be distinguished at in fact two vessels, 
locked in mortal combat. The first, on this side of the waters is most definately a &Kpirate ship&c,
with the infamous &Wskull and crossbones&c flag flying high. The ship itself is in a ragged
condition, and it's suprising it can even stay afloat. The main mast is split in half, with it's
sails laying torn and tattered across its deck. Several large holes line the hold, some near
water level. At times a large wave pours a few hundred gallons of water through one of the holes
of the ship, but it seems to have no affect at all..odd. The second ship, obviously in better 
condition, is rather hard to see from this vantage point. It appears to remain mostly intact,
but from the clangs of battle coming from its deck, that may soon change. A strange unknown flag
colored &Ggreen&c and &Kblack&c with a sword between a set of almond shaped eyes flies from its mast,
and so far has remained unscathed.&n

&c  What once appeared to be a single ship can now be distinguished at in fact two vessels, 
locked in mortal combat. The first, on this side of the waters appears to be a &ywarship&c of 
unknown origins. A flagged colored &Ggreen&c and &Kblack&c with a sword set between a set of 
almond eyes, flies proud atop the main mast. The ship seems to be fairly intact, with little 
battle damage being visible, but from the sounds of battle currently going on on the deck, the
poor galleon may not last much longer. The other ship, barely visible from this vantage point,
is apparently a &Kpirate&c ship, with its infamous &Wskull and crossbones&c flag flying proudly.
It is difficult to determine the extent of the damage the pirate ship has taken from here, but
what glimpses you do catch of the evil boat boat show it to be in much worse shape than the 
vessel in front of you.&n

bodies, both human, lay slumped against the railing which has begun to turn &rcrimson&y from
their &rblood&y. This vantage point, which is higher than the bulk of the ship, provides you with
a good view of what is going on with the battle. Only about a score of the humans still live, 
the majority of which are beginning to head below decks to give them a fighting advantage. 
Dozens of undead still fill the deck, most of them &Wskeletons&y with different color variations, 
but several &Yzombies&y can be seen among the groups as well. The humans are quickly losing this
battle, and you may be their only hope.&n

  &yThe helm has been abandoned due to the fighting going on all around. This ship, and the 
pirate ship on the starboard side have been locked together, so neither would be going anywhere
anyway. A number of the ships crew have begun to retreat to a hatch set in the helm that most
likely leads to the cargo hold under the deck. Given the number of undead foes that have begun
boarding the ship, the closer quarters may give the humans a good fighting advantage.&n

Joining the Brimstonian Navy has been a dream come true. I hardly know where to begin there

&cMy Dearest Eileen,
  We have been at sea for a week now. The captain still has not disclosed where we are headed,
just that we are an important diplomatic mission for our new country. We carried a passenger
when we left port. He was a huge hulking fellow he was. Looked more suited for fighting than
talking...(End Message)&n

&cMother,
  I realize I should have written you sooner, I just didn't know the right words to say. I know
You did not want me to join the navy, but I feel it was something I simply had to do to win the
hand of my dearest Eileen. Do not fret, for we are still a new country, and still have few 
enemies. The odds of myself being killed in battle (End of Message)&n

  Most of the entries are insignificant, but two recent entries do catch your eye:

Entry #29:
   A mysterious storm has appeared suddenly. It almost seems to be alive and block our every
attempt at mapping the ocean for the council. The men are growing restless, and I fear that I
too am starting to become affected by this mystical maelstrom. I am turning the ship back to 
port to see if perhaps the city's mages can give me some information on how to dispel, or bypass
this magical barrier.


Entry #33:
  I have noticed for several days now that we are being followed by a mysterious ship. I have 
not yet informed any of my crew other than the lookout and my first mate. I can only hope this
has been the correct decision.

&yMakeshift Barricade&n~
&y  Boxes and crates and bundles of cloth are stacked near the cargo hold entrance in a hasty
attempt to block out any unwanted visitors. Several &Kgaps&y do exist for any remaining crew members 
to scurry through before the &wundead&y arrive, but those that are assembled here now are the major-
ity of the survivors. Most of the remaining crates on the hold have been arranged for defensive
purposes, allowing for maximum protection against any &Kghoul&y who may make it through the barri-
cade alive. The remaining survivors look tired and worn, but a steadfast determination shows in
their eyes that this fight is not yet over.&n

&yInside the '&KWailing Banshee&y'&n~
&y  The view below decks makes the view above look like a scene of perfect housekeeping. The floor-
boards have almost thoroughly rotted, making each step an adventure. Personal affects lay scattered
all about, most ruined by time and the constant moisture in the air. The small hallways that you 
are in leads off to the east towards the cargo hold. To the north and south lie doors to unknown 
rooms while the hatch above leas back to the deck.&n

&KZombie Captain&y's Room&n~
  &yThis was probably at one time a very wonderous room. Now all that remains are a molded bed
and the splintered remains of a desk and table that sit upon a shredded rug. Though numerous papers
lie scattered about, most of the writing on them has been smudged due to moisture and time and are
thus unreadable. The only item of interest left in the room is a large &Ygolden chest&y that sits
next to the bed, seemingly untouched by the ravages of time.&n

&yA Small Room&n~
  &yWhatever this room once was, it is totally destroyed now. The shattered remains of several
wooden objects lie all about, but you are unable to determine what they once were. There appears to
be nothing of interest in the room and the only exit lies through the door to the north.&n

&yCargo Hold of the '&KWailing Banshee&y'&n~
  &yThere is not much left of the hold of this once great ship. What once would have been here has
most likely been swept to sea through the huge gaping hole in the port side of the ship. The hole 
is so large in fact, that much of the hold is missing, and the smell of salt water is in the air
as the occasional wave finds its way in.&n

&cA Path Through the &KRaging Storm&n~
&c  Waves rise and crash all around as great swells threaten to pull you under with every heart-
beat. &WGreat winds&c whip around, ripping shreds of clothing off your body and tearing at your
skin. Every ounce of your strength has to be used in order to stay afloat, and though this 
narrow path through the storm is difficult to get through, it is still navigable at this point.&n

&KThe Cave of Karandokis&n~
&K  Set upon a very tiny island in the middle of the ocean, this cave shows signs of habitation.
A large woven rug covrs the floor, providing a bit of comfort for sitting without getting overly
dirty. A small table is set on the middle of the rug, and several wooden plates with half eaten
food still sit upon it. The only other noticable feature in the cave is a small cot with a woolen
blanket that sits against the far wall of the cave.&n
