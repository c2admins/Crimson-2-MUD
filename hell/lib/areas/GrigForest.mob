&yThe &wW&yy&wv&ye&wr&yn&n, dragon of the undead stands before you.
~
This strange beast of the underworld has risen from its grave and taken up
hold in this dark and danty place.  You can see the scales on this creature
are cold and brown.  There is no longer a beating heart in this beast you
can detect.  You wonder what kind of madman would summon a beast such as
this from its place of eternal rest.
