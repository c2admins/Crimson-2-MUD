A dark pathway under the stars~
You leave the confines of a well travelled road and enter into a seemingly 
deep forest. A dreadful, mirky place under the light of an unnatural sky.

A courtyard, long dead from the passage of time, where red and white flowers 
once bloomed, stands as a monument to decay and ill-fate. All that can be
seen now are the black, withered remains of plants and shrubbery, and the 
tall, twisting gnarled trees left to withstand the cold, frigid nights.

Glass Hallway~
Glass walls flicker with light, sending multi-color rays down the
corridor. A huge place this is, for the hallway seems to never end, 
or is it just the light playing with your imagination.

The Sacrificial Alter~
An intricate artwork of stained glass, this room is a vile and unholy
place for the corrupt. Sacrificing infants, slaves, and small animals 
to a god who doesn't even exist, these bringers of death have no mercy 
on anything.

The Pit to Hell~
A gorry place indeed, the mutilated bodies are brought here to be dumped,
where they will fall until reaching the burning sulphur pits of hell, whereby
they can be eaten, and the lost souls will strengthen the beast that lies
below.

The Summoning Circle~
Standing amongst a blood-red pentagram, you hear a chant coming from 
nearby. A purple flame rises from the ground licking at you, cold to the 
touch. From the flames comes a large Balrog ready to feast. With a final 
word it is ordered to attack.

Arial's Chamber of Pain~
A horrid room this is, body parts flung about, who could be capable of 
such mutilation? You suddenly become aware of the answer, as you see a 
skimpy dressed drow female raising a hand at you. Could you be next?

Kitchen~
Barely a manner of food found in this place, the only thing the inhabitants 
seem to be eating are brains. Zombies stand posed over the bodies of dead 
beings, but quickly turn after a fresh meal...You!

Sir Licky's Chamber~
Amongst a room filled with weapons and devices, one man stands over them 
all. Cleaning the blade of his great sword, he stares intently on you. 
Slowly he stands and then bows, and in an instance he lunges forth.
