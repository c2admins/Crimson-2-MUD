&KMalkavian is here, sulking in the corner&n

&wYou have come face to face with one of the most powerful beings in the universe, something however, seems amiss.  As you gaze into his eyes, Malkavian begins to relate his story to you telepathically.
&c-Long ago, I roamed this planet weilding the power of the cosmos.  My minions were innumerable and my was name revered across the land.  All was well until a dark day when I felt a strange tremor in the worlds energy.
I however, wraped in my own glory, ignored this fluke, and proceeded in my daily tasks without a second thought.
Later I came to understand, that the very tremor I had felt, was in fact the birth of he who would be the destruction of my being, that strange cosmic quake, had been the birth of the Nosferatu.
As one of the few descendants of the wyrm who had survived the journey to this planet, my power had been unquestioned in this world, and subsequently I had lowered my defences almost completely, and my skills had grown rusty.
When I became of the Nosferatu, and his plans for me, I sought power in the ancients.  As I searched for the great sigil, in the hope it would empower me to a point in which I could destroy him, I was hunted every step of the way.
But at last, I found the components to create what would have been my saving grace, and as i knelt at the altar, proud, triumphant, and utterly defenseless, he came from behind, and ended all that I was.
A single stake passed through my heart, and all was lost.&n
