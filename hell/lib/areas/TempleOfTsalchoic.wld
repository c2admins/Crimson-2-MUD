End of the corridor.~
The corridor here ends suddenly where the wall looks as if this was a 
half-hearted attempt at digging out a larger underground section of the temple,
but was given up for some reason.  There are one or two small stones on the
ground, but most of the debris you would expect has been cleared.

End of the corridor.~
The corridor here ends abruptly at a wall, which looks as if when the temple 
was constructed they had planned for a larger complex here, but gave up after
a little work had been completed.

Edge of the forest.~
To the west of here you can see a huge temple built from white stones that
reaches above the treetops.  East of here is a thick forest that stretches
almost all the way back to Midgaard.  It looks dark, but you know that being
so close to the city, it ought to be fairly safe from bandits.

End of the corridor.~
What looks like the beginnings of a new corridor here ends abruptly at a
stoney wall.  The reasons are unknown, but it appears this section was 
abandoned shortly after it was begun, leaving only a few small traces of
debris on the ground.
