 &W May 28, 2009 -
   &w*&n The WIPE code has been modified.  Players and kits will still be
      wiped.  Avatars will not be wiped for 12 months. The remaining morts
      have had their wipe time extended for more information regarding this
      see "help wipe". We are now running version 177 of the code.

 &W August 3, 2009 -

   &w*&n Please welcome Ishtar and Oldschool as our newest Immortal staff
      members!  They are eager to help out in any way possible and provide
      much-needed support with quests and general administrative duties.
   &w*&n If you have sent mudmails to Sprocket and you are waiting for a
      reply you should consider sending an email.  Sprocket can be reached
      at c2admins@gmail.com (it's the email address on the greet page).
   &w*&n The wizlist has been updated.  Type "wizlist" to see your current
      immortal / supervisory staff.

 &W April 7, 2009 - 

   &w*&n Welcome Maugan'Ra as our latest Immortal member.  He has agreed
      to help out with various administrative duties and interact with
      the player base more regularly than Sprocket or Relic tend to
      visit.  Everyone please make Maugan'Ra feel welcome.

 &W January 17, 2009 -

   &w*&n Yay, another code update.  For some of you, the latest version
      will be very apparent.  Among other things, you should notice now
      a reminder to vote for our mud via the MUDCONNECTOR website.  This
      recommendation was made by Bane / Archangel.  Good suggestion!

 &W November 22, 2008 -

   &w*&n Yet another code update.  This newest revision can only be
      seen by immortals, so don't go blind trying to spot something
      new in the game. 

 &W November 15, 2008 -

   &w*&n The code has been updated again!  We are now running version
      165 of Crimson II.  Bask in its glory.

 &W October 5, 2008 -

   &w*&n The mud server's CCO modem was replaced today by another new
      unit.  This should (hopefully) mean that we will no longer cut
      out and effectively drop our connection to the game.  Please
      keep in mind that you should regularly save and backup in case
      your connection should be lost for any reason (your connection
      or mine).

 &W September 26, 2008 -

   &w*&n Same deal as yesterday, modem lights were out when I got home
      and I hit the power button while checking to see if the modem was
      still plugged in...this modem connectivity issue will be addressed
      tomorrow with the ISP.
   &w*&n Sorry for any inconveniences.

 &W September 25, 2008 -

   &w*&n Okay, we didn't really have a crash tonight.  The modemrouter
      through which the mud server is connected decided to shut off.
   &w*&n In my (Sprocket's) zeal to figure out why it shut off, I hit
      the power switch on the surge protected power strip and shut off
      everything attached to it, including the server.
   &w*&n Oops.
 
 &W September 20, 2008 -

   &w*&n New code has been ported!  We are now running version 162 of
      our code, which includes among other fixes the Demon Bug fix and
      the new immortal structure.  Demons should be aware of the fact
      that they will no longer have unnaturally low AC or extra attacks
      above and beyond those they've earned through skills or equipment.
   &w*&n There are now only two tiers of game administration.  All
      general immortals are level 48 and come equipped with command
      clusters depending upon the specific task that immortal performs.
      The level 50 immortals are the game owners (Relic and Sprocket)
      or other god-like authority.
 
 &W August 22, 2008 -

   &w*&n With the exception of this weekend, the MUD has had a strong
      continuous uptime of over 4 weeks.  The Xanth issues causing the
      crashes this weekend have been corrected and will be reflected in
      our next code port.
   &w*&n Speaking of our next code port, the Demon racial bug has been
      corrected.  For those demons out there, play 'em while you've got
      those handy little bugs.
   &w*&n The bulletin boards around the game are going to be cleared up
      within the next few days.  If there is useful information you'd
      like to keep saved, let Sprocket know before the end of the week. 

 &W July 21, 2008 -

   &w*&n Whoa...we haven't done any News updates in a while!
   &w*&n The MUD has moved!  Again!  Due to unfortunate circumstances
       regarding Relic's former ISP and the untimely death of the MUD
       machine's power supply (e.g. the Shuttle's power supply), you
       may have noticed that the game was down for about 3 weeks.
   &w*&n Shalira has corrected the domain mud.crimson2.net to now point
       at the new game IP address (75.146.133.214 4000).  Feel free to
       connect using either method.
   &w*&n Regarding the Shuttle power supply issue, the new power supply
       does NOT fit in the computer case.  Right now it is jury-rigged
       and sitting outside the case on a piece of ceramic tile.  A new
       case is being formulated now.  At this time, the design involves
       crafting a case out of wood (yes, wood) for that old-school feel.
       This will translate into more downtime at a later date.  Sprocket
       will keep everyone posted as designs develop.&n 

 &W January 22, 2008 -

   &w*&n Fixed some crashing bugs that had hit us since the host change
       and also made some more improvemants to the who list.

 &W January 22, 2008 -

   &w*&n This is the new host.  If you see this message, you're good!

 &W January 18, 2008 -
 
   &w*&n New host is up and ready to go.  Please log into this IP:

   &R99.148.0.70&n

   &RNOTE:&W NONE of your accomplishments from here on out will be moved 
          to the new server.  Please play over there and report issues
          as you find them.

 &W December 30, 2007 - &n
 
   &w*&n In record time, Disraeli advances to Latorrmis!  Please welcome
       Disraeli to his current post and correspond with him regarding
       quests and general game information.
   &w*&n Speaking of quests, there will be New Year's quests running for
       the next couple days, so please ask around and participate if you
       feel up to a good ol' hack 'n slash quest.  Ask Disraeli for details.

 &W December 27, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n Please welcome our newest immortal Disraeli!  Disraeli's current
       status is Revetas.  Please congratulate him at your earliest convenience.

 &W December 26, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n Now that Christmas has come and gone, the Winter Wonderland is closed.
       Keep your eyes open for new zones and quests to take its place in
       the coming weeks.

 &W December 17, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n We're moving!  Sometime shortly after Christmas our game will
       be moving from Europe to the United States.  Our new home is soon
       to be Kansas City, Missouri.  Many thanks to Shalira for hosting
       our game for so long, and thanks to Relic for being our new host.
       Please continue to connect using mud.crimson2.net.  The IP address
       will change, but mud.crimson2.net will still point to the game.
   &w*&n Multi-play rules are changing.  Please be advised that there is
       now no limit to the number of active avatars you can play outside
       of the reception.  There is still no limit to the number of mortals
       you can play outside of the reception.  Please keep in mind that
       this rule can change back if recklessly exploited.
   &w*&n Please keep in mind the botting rules.  Botting is only allowed
       during the evenings / early morning between midnight and 8:00 am
       Eastern Standard Time.  Botting outside of the established botting
       hours will result in jail time (there is no recourse).  Jail time
       is decided by the administrative immortal on at the time.
   &w*&n By the way, botting outside of the allowed botting hours while
       taking advantage of the relaxed multi-avat rule is an excellent
       way to lose kits, players, or both.  Please bot responsibly.

 &W December 8, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n Winter Wonderland is open!  Enjoy the zone during this holiday
       season.  Winter Wonderland (start room 24480) will be open only
       through the end of December.  Gear has a 50% pop rate.

 &W November 2, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n Fixed more crashing bugs
   &w*&n Fixed the AFW/AFK who list bugs
   &w*&n Added the <Quest> flag to the who list
   &w*&n Added forms to the who list (in a slightly different fashion)
   &w*&n Added parts of the changelog feature

 &W October 23, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n Fixed three known crashing bugs
   &w*&n The who list now indicates AFW and AFK players, and displays
       idle ticks for idle players
   &w*&n Important spells (forms and sanctuary) are &Whighlighted &nin
       the spells list.

 &W September 18, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n The code's been updated!  Miscellaneous bug fixes have been
       made, including the issue with the game crashing immediately
       after a death.

 &W September 11, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n NewbieVillage and GnomeVillage are now enhanced.  Changes
       include new rooms, new mobs, and new gear.  Both zones should
       be more enjoyable to play for a lower-level mortal.

 &W August 27, 2007 - &n
   &w*&n Lots of behind the scene restructuring has gone on.  There are 
       some new goodies like automatic backups.  There have also been a
       number of bug fixes, per normal.
