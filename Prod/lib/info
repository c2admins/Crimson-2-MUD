the HELP-command]

Classes, races, skills, and guilds:
===================================
When you first enter the MUD and make a new Character, you are given a
choice of 34 RACEs and 7 CLASSes to choose from. Given your choices, your
character will be different from others in the skills and attributes you
have. There are 4 basic classes to a MUD, these are Warrior, Thief,
Cleric, and Mage. After that you have 3 more classes, which are Priest,
which is a Warrior/Cleric combo, Bard, a Warrior/Mage, and Paladin, a
Warrior who fights against evil.

By GROUPing with players of other CLASSes you will have a better chance
of survival and an easier time of adventuring. A case of this would be
where you had a Warrior who would tank for the group (Tanking means they
take the damage from the monster), a Cleric healing and creating
food and other sustenance for the GROUP, a Mage using their battle
spells to harm the monster, and a Thief backstabbing the monster.

Some CLASSes and RACEes must maintain a certain ALIGNment, that is
Good, Evil, Neutral. If you stray from this ALIGNment you will
begin to suffer and eventually die.

Improving your Character:
=========================
In order to learn the tricks of your specific trade, you need to find
your GUILD, which may take a little exploring. However, you can most
like get a hint to where it will be by looking at the MAP. Once you've
found it, you need to find the guildmaster and PRACTICE <skill
you wish to improve>. For a list of every skill you currently
know type PRACTICE with no arguments. (You start with no skills or
spells so this should be first on your agenda). The other way you
can improve your character (once you are high enough in level) is to
find the high priestess in the Temple of T'Salchoic and buy increased
ability scores and various other things.

Equipment:
==========
It is never wise to travel without the proper equipment. You may
purchase this in the SHOPS found in any larger city, or you may
be lucky and find some left around, perhaps in the Donation room
dropped by someone who doesn't need it anymore, for one reason or
another.

related commands:
GET ALL       To pickup everything in a room
EQUIP         to see what you are equipped with
WEAR ALL      equip with everything you are carrying
WIELD <ITEM>  Start using <item> as a weapon
REMOVE <ITEM> Stop using <item> whether it be armor or weapon


About Staying Fit - Eating and Drinking:
========================================
At one time or another, you'll see the message "You are hungry".
This means that it's time to find something edible before too
long. People don't starve to death in this world, so have no
fear. However, when you are hungry, you do not build up lost
energy, so eventually you'll be unable to do anything but sit
around and feel sorry for yourself, until someone comes by.
Then, you can only hope that it's a benevolent person,
rather than a greedy thief or a warrior lusting for blood.

To stave off this rather horrible state one of the first thing
s you should do is obtain multiple loaves of bread from the
baker, and a barrel of water.

Related commands:
BUY BARREL           at the bar in the inn.
POUR BARREL OUT      empty the barrel of ale.
POUR FOUNTAIN BARREL fill the barrel with water from the fountain.
EAT BREAD            eat some bread.
DRINK BARREL         drink water from the barrel.

Safety Issues
=============
There is safety in numbers, especially pairs. When you form a group,
experience for a kill is first doubled and then split amongst the members
of the group. This means that a group a two will *EACH* recieve the same
experience for a joint kill as they would for killing the foe alone! To
form a group, designate someone as the group leader and have everyone 
FOLLOW <leader> (except the leader of course). Next the leader should 
GROUP <Player> everyone in the group, including him/herself. Once the Group
has been formed you can monitor each group members statistics by typing:
GROUP with no arguments. Use the ASSIST command so that the group will
gang up on foes automaticly. And remembers allways use the AUTOFLEE command
because although you lose experience for running away, you lose more for
dying.

How am I doing?, whats going on?
================================
Almost all informative commands will provide more information as you
go up in level. Accordingly, dont be alarmed when you type WHO to
see whos playing and notice that there are blanks to the left of
most characters names. If you only wish to see players close to you
type WHERE. Those of you interested in how close you are to gaining
a level can check out your characters statistics by typing SCORE.
Once you have gained a few levels the SPELLS command will show affecting
spells, their affects and their durations. The ATT command will also
show you info about your character. Your inventory can be shown by the
INV command. Practice infomation can be found with the PRAC command. You
can customize your prompt by using the DISPLAY command. I recommend DISPLAY
ALL to show character statistics and all visible exits on the prompt.


Communication
=============
SAY    - speak your mind to anyone in the same room.
SHOUT  - try not to use this channel.
GOSSIP - everyone will hear you, unless they have set their GOSSIP
         Channel off.
TELL   - say something to any ONE person on the mud (wherever they are)
(just the tip of the iceberg of course but this is the important stuff)

How do I keep my equipment?
===========================
If you quit from the game you *DROP* *EVERYTHING* you are carrying
right where you were. If you wish to keep it for the next session
you must find the inn (where you enter the game) and RENT at the
receptionist. You can see how much it will cost you to rent by
typing OFFER. Sometime in the near future low-level characters will
be given a rent "allowance" to help them get started. While you are
at the receptionist check out WITHDRAW, DEPOSIT and BALANCE after all
you cant be pickpocketed by thieves if your money is in the bank.....


Getting around Midgaard from Market Square.
===========================================
Royal Academy - you start here go S D W S to get to Market Square.
The following directions are form Market Square
Dressing Room - N E U U
Heals - N N N, then type pray, this is only until level 10
Healer Room - U, rest for a bit and Nedra will give you some spell buffs
Fountain - right beside you.
Reception - N E U
General store - E N
Clerics Guild - N W
Mages Guild - W W S
Thieves Guild - S E S
Warriors Guild - E E S
Weapons Shop - E E N
Armor Shop - W S                          
Baker - W N
Mages shop - W W N
Pet shop - E S
Dump - S S
Snotling Camp - W W W W N N N N N N N
Gnome Village - W W W W N N N N N N
Temple of T'Salchoic - N N N N N N N W W W N N W N W

Fighting:
=========
Every monster in the game can be referred to as MOB, every object as
OBJ. Why tell you here? good question possibly because KILL MOB will
kill the first monster in a room (watch out here pet owners). KILL
2.MOB will kill the second monster in a room. And for you Dragon-kin
out there just starting off: BREATH GAS MOB. (If it says nothing
keep trying, in fact type !<return> about 20 times and sooner or
later is will succeed (! repeats last command) maybe you should
practice some more huh?) For mages try: CAST 'MAGIC MISSLE' MOB
(you did practice this spell right?) GET 2.OBJ etc works similarly
to the commands described above.


MUD Slang:
==========
On MUDs, people usually use ACRONYMs and other slang words, you
can see a list of the ACRONYMs in that helpfile, but some of the
slang words are:

Round - What it is called when a MOB hits you and you hit a MOB
Run - The lenght of time a full fight took, IE if you have to flee
      and heal, but go back and kill the MOB, then it is 2 runs


General hints:
