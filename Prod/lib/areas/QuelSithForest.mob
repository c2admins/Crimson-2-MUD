mob kil'ron mor black~
&yA &Kblack &yKil'Ron Mor&n~
&yA &Kblack&y Kil'Ron Mor watches you from a distance.&n
~
     Rumors say that the Kil'Ron Mor were created when an ordinary wolf took
shelter inside the fabled Elven Tree of Life on a cold winter night. The magic
of the tree granted that wolf increased intelligence and size in exchange for
the protection of the elves. Whether this story is actually true or not is un-
known, but the Elves of the Quel'Sith and the strange wolves do share a bond 
that has lasted for generations. Once a bond is created, one would gladly die
to save the other in any battle.
     The magnificent beast before you stands nearly six feet tall at the 
shoulder. Jet black fur accents sharp green eyes that stare at you with a pro-
found intellect not found in normal beasts. In every other respect, the Kil'Ron
Mor looks like a normal wolf.

&yThe &Gdryad&n~
&yA beautiful &Gdryad&y walks among the trees.&n
~
A spirit of the forest, the dryad appears as a beautiful human female with
very striking features. Her being is bound by the trees, and because of that
she can't travel far from her home. Rumor has it that a dryad can charm any
male that looks upon her at will, and often uses her charmed companions to
protect her during an attack.

&wA shy little &Cnixie&w plays in the &cwater&w here.&n

enter their waters. They are not a warlike race, but will rise up in force
if provoked.

Being aquatic creatures, their hands and feet are webbed, and they have gills
as well as lung to survive on both land and underwater. They are usually un-
armed, but in times of need, carry tridents and other weapons good for aquatic
fighting.

&yA small, curious looking gnome covered in &Gmoss&y stands here.&n
~
     Forest gnomes stand much shorter than their more common cousins, but in
all other respects resemble them exactly the same. In order to use their small
height as an advantage, they usually cover themselves is moss and/or small
branches and twigs to better camouflage themselves.

&yThe treant&n~
&yA large &Gtree&y with a face carved in it grows here.&n
~
     If it hadn't have moved you would have sworn this was just an
ordinary tree, but it's most definately alive. Gnarled branches suddenly
become arms, and roots that were once planted into the ground suddenly 
rise up to become something resembling feet. This creature is a treant, 
the protector of the forest. Those with good intentions are safe, but whoever
is bold enough to bring evil into this forest had better fear the treant's 
wrath.

     Born to serve nature, the druid spends most of his time protecting
the forest creatures from outside poachers. The years have worn him down,

a long green robe and a cudgel used to fight off intruders.

will ferociously defend its new home. It happens to like it here and
does not wish to leave.

~
  Thought to be kin of elves, quicklings resemble their cousins in most
respects save size. They stand roughly two feet tall, what they lack in 
size, they more than make up for in speed. When running at full capability, 
quicklings appear to be little more than blurs, hence where they get their 
names.

~
  Hamadryads differ from their cousins, the dryads in very few ways. The only 
real difference lies within the time they can spend away from their tree homes, 
and the hamadryads lack of male charming. Otherwise, the hamadryad has the
same bronzed skin and auburn hairs that her cousins do, and appears exactly
the same.
