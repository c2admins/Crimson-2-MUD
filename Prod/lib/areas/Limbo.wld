Limbo~
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

A dark smelly jail cell.~
 You find yourself in a dark, dank and horribly filthy stone cell. The walls
have been built from large stone blocks, and have moss growing from the cracks
between them. There is a small window in the wall which allows a little light
in to faintly illuminate the room, but it is about 15 feet from the ground and
you cannot see through it. The ground is covered in straw, but it is very dirty
and the smell is pungent.
 You pray that you do not have to stay here long.

This small room is obviously just an entryway to a room just to the west.  The gentle drip
of water and the dim lighting belies the intensity of this area.  Beyond the west door is
a fierce challenge to regain gear that was abandoned by folly.  But before you can even
face that challenge, you must get the key.  And the keeper of that key doesn't seem very
inclined to just hand it over.  Are you up to the challenge?  Kill the keeper, unlock the
door and pray that retrieval goes smoothly!

&KRel&ri&Kc's Sanctuary&n~
You're in the middle of a boundless field, with only a few noticable
features.  There is a large arrangement of immense in the
middle of the field.  There are torches lit around it, all flickering
very quickly and intensely.  The sky overhead fluctuates from blue
to black very quickly, as does the temperature.  During the
stunted days, it's quite pleasant, and the nights are a bit chilly.

The field is covered by long grass, and is also inhabited by
one lonely tree.

As evidenced by the flickering of the torches and accelerated
days and nights, time passes here much more quickly than
normal.  Only animals seem to be immune to this affect,
ass the grass and the tree quickly cycle threw their lives,
passing from Spring to Winter in a matter of mere hours.

&KHere is the problem: for many years, the &wSupreme Court &Kwrestled with
the issue of &Bpornography&K, until finally &RAssociate Justice John Paul
Stevens&K came up with the famous quotation about how he couldn't define
&Bpornography&K, but he knew it when he saw it.  So for a while, the
court's policy was to have all the suspected &Bpornography&K trucked to
&RJustice Stevens'&K house, where he would look it over.  &c"&BNope, this isn't
it,&c" &Khe'd say.  &c"&BBring some more.&c"&K  This went on until one morning when
his housekeeper found him trapped in the recreation room under an
enormous mound of rubberized implements, and the &wcourt&K had to issue a
ruling stating that it didn't know what the hell &Bpornography&K was except
that it was illegal and everybody should stop badgering the &wcourt&K about
it because the &wcourt&K was going to take a nap.&n

&c[&wDistrict Attorneys&c] &Klearn in &wDistrict Attorney School&K that there are
two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favorable publicity:

&C(&c1&C) &BGo down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate &Y53 &ymarijuana&B cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
    of &Y850 &Bmillion.  These raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least &Y53 &ymarijuana&B
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    factory puts them there.
&C(&c2&C) &BRaid an &c"&Badult book store&c"&B and hold a press conference where you
    announce you are charging the owner with &Y850&B counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because you always
    get a conviction.  A juror at a &Kpornography&B trial is not about to
    state for the record that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
    where actors engage in sexual activities with live &gsnakes&B and a
    &Rfire extinguisher&B.  He is going to convict the bookstore owner, and
    vote for the death penalty just to make sure nobody gets the wrong
    impression.

electricity~

&WHere is a simple experiment that will teach you an important &Yelectrical
&Wlesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach
your hand into a friend's mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.
Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in
pain?  This teaches us that &Yelectricity &Wcan be a very powerful force,
but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an
important &Yelectrical &Wlesson.

It also teaches us how an &Yelectrical &Wcircuit works.  When you scuffed
your feet, you picked up batches of "&Yelectrons&W", which are very small
objects that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will
attract dirt.  The &Yelectrons&W travel through your bloodstream and
collect in your finger, where they form a spark that leaps to your
friend's filling, then travels down to his feet and back into the
carpet, thus completing the circuit.

Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything, you would build up so many &Yelectrons&W that your
finger would explode!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you
have carpeting.

&ROnce upon a time, there was a non-conforming &ysparrow &Rwho decided not to
fly south for the &Cwinter&R.  However, soon after the weather turned &Ccold&R,
the &ysparrow &Rchanged his mind and reluctantly started to fly south.
After a short time, &Cice&R began to form his on his wings and he fell to
earth in a barnyard almost &Cfrozen&R.  A &gcow &Rpassed by and crapped on this
little &ybird &Rand the &ysparrow &Rthought it was the end, but the &ymanure&R
warmed him and defrosted his wings.  Warm and happy the little &ysparrow&R
began to sing.  Just then, a large &rTom cat&R came by and hearing the
chirping investigated the sounds.  As Old &rTom&R cleared away the manure,
he found the chirping &ybird&R and promptly ate him.

&YThere are three morals to this story:

You enter a dark, smokey room.  The smell of tobacco, beer and vomit hang in the air, 
creating a wall of repulsion that would make even the most grizzled warrior reconsider
entering.  Passing the bar and some tables, at which some questionable characters are 
sitting, you head to the far back corner.  Seated with his back to the wall, facing the
entry is the Bounty Master.  His skills in assassination, deception and battle are
known well to you.  Still, rather than take an active part in the "harsher realities" of
life, the Bounty Master has now become a business man - taking contracts and doling them
out.  Approach him carefully, and make your business known.  The Bounty Master doesn't
care for people who just... hang around.

&bSa&Bp&Kph&Bi&bre B&Blu&be &wBu&Wt&Kte&Wrf&wly M&Kea&Wd&wow&n~

&cThe warm &Ysun&c shines down on a meadow filled with luscious &Ggreenery&c and the prettiest
&bsa&Bp&Kph&Bi&bre b&Blu&be&c flowers one has ever laid eyes on.  As you wander through the enormous
&ywrought&w iron&c gate and on to the &Kstone&c path, you notice that the &gflowe&rrs&c aren't really
&cflowers, but pretty little &bsa&Bp&Kph&Bi&bre &wbu&Wt&Kte&Wrf&wli&Ke&ws&c.  Then, as if to answer your unasked
&cquestion, a &Cbreeze&c blows across the meadow and the branches of &wwe&Wep&wing &Kwi&Wl&wlow&c part and
out steps a &Wbeautiful woman&c.  She is clothed in &rerotic garb&c - black corset, thigh-high
boots and a &bsa&Bp&Kph&Bi&bre b&Blu&be&c garter, etc.  Her long hair hangs past her waist and is of the
&cpurest &Wwhite&c.  She smiles at you as her &wdi&Wam&Ko&Wn&wd&c and &bsa&Bp&Kph&Bi&bre&c wings unfold behind her.
&cShe flutters to the &Bsky&c and makes her way to you.  Once she reaches you, she cracks her 
&Kwhip &cand inquires, "are you &Cgood&c or &rbad&c??" Sure hope you answer correctly... &n
