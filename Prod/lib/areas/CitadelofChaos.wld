Lair of Sinth, Minotaur Savage~
You stand amongst a discusting minotaur lair filled with ornaments from the
battle field, all decaying or rusting on the floor.  This lair has been carved
out of the rock under the mountain, and is a basicly round shape, with the 
roof sloping to about five foot high at the northern part of the room.

Lair of Tiron, Minotaur Savage~
An old cave carved into the middle of the mountain has provided a great lair
for a very savage minotaur.  The roof of this cave is about nine foot above
the ceiling but it slopes downwards into a wall at the far end.  Rusty armor
and decaying bones clutter up most of the floor space in this cave.

Lair of Fasht, Minotaur Savage~
This lair is half cave, and half built up out of the surface of mountain.
The once was a window in the southen wall that looked down the mountain side,
but that has been boarded up to keep the place dark clod and gloomy.

Pathway to Chaos.~
You are walking along a wide pathway that winds its way through the foothills of
a large volcanic mountain to the west.  You can just make out a large citadel
in this mountain, beneath the heat and smoke of the massive active volcano.
A broken down wagon lies overturned off to one side of the track, covering what 
appears to be a large gate....

wagon~
It looks like the wagon carried some kind of grain at one time.  The 
remaining cargo that hasn't been looted, has long ago perished in the heat.
