Under the Floor Panels~
You crawl under the floor panels and end up in a long, narrow
tunnel that leads East.  The walls and floor are damp and 
dusty.  You can hear the guards walking around above.

Hall of the White Flame.~
The hall comes to an end.  To the West is a large, white door.
When you touch it you feel a great warmth.  To the North is 
the castle scriptorium.

A Large, Spacious Cave~
  This large cavern spreads several hundred feet into the side of the cliff wall. Several
stone idols of dragons bear numerous offerings beneath them, though most are meats and bear
little market value. Several piles of gold, many as high as a mans head lie stacked in no
obvious order around the cave. It would appear that this is the den of a dragon.

Scriptorium~
You are in a room with rows of large desks with many people
sitting at them writing out line after line upon scrolls.
Shelves lie against the far North wall with hundreds of 
scrolls stacked upon them.

Rocky Trail~
  A small path leads up to the cliff face that runs alongside Castle White Flame. Though
it is difficult to traverse, it is obvious from the wear on the surrounding rocks that
the path is used quite often.
