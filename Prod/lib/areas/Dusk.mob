mob Heng Ghoul~
Heng~
Heng the Ghoul Lord awaits his dark calling.
~
The first thing you notice about this ghoul is that it is seems some
how more human.  As you study its features it dawns on you how similar
this monster is to a hero that once walked the realms.  There were 
stories of a great warrior avatar disappearing years ago without a trace
... Could this have been his fate... to become an undead servant of evil..
The saddess expression crosses his face for a moment, but it is quickly
replaced by the expression of mindless savagery.

The Vatang~
The Vampire Monster Vatang eyes you with hunger.
~
Rotting flesh barely hangs from this near rotten corpse.  Eons of unlife have
left this monsterous creature far from any recognizable creature you have ever
seen or even heard of.  Two inch fangs hang from its slobbering mouth.  
Entrails hang out where skin has split apart from ages of rot.

to you and stands.
