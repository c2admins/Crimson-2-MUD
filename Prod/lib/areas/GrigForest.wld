The entrance to the Grig Forest~
These forest seem very bright and spooky.  You can see there
are many twigs and branches that glow with a mystical light.
The forest is very dense yet very traveled.  Most of these
creatures are winged and very naughty.

Inside the Grig Forest~
You can see there is a magical spell bounding the forest together.
A sort of ethereal line binding the trees up and the rocks in their place.
There has been some sort of magic afoot here.  You notice
there are some small cricket looking creatures running amuck.
They are the Grigs of the forest.  They defend and look
after these forests.

Deep inside the Grig Forest~
You can see these little creatures everywhere.  They seem to
flock like locusts.  The forest seems to have a magical song that
draws you in.  Many of these creatures are pretty harmless but
watch out for the mothers protecting their young!  They can
be very viscious.

Home of Krailin~
This is the home of Krailin the Grig.  He is a master blacksmith of the Grigs.
They say his forging is only matched by a powerful mage.  You can
see there are some special powers afoot.  He has a very large
anvil in the middle of his room with shelves of great weapons
on the walls.

The home of Manush the Grig~
Manush the Grig resides here.  He is a small little man with a
very bad temper.  Very few creatures trade here as his prices
are a bit steep.  You can see the selection he has.  Many 
travelers come here and have no where else to turn for small
things such as recalls or yellow potions.  He is a masterful
magician of the village.  Very few ever come into opposition with
him.

Home of Mysphit~
This is the home of the Mysphit.  He is a strange character indeed.
If you can stand the smell he welcomes you in.  He has a fresh
load of moonshadow droppings to help with his planting.
He grows magical herbs and remidies.  Most of these are for
helping to cure the blind and heal the battle scares.  You can
see by the gesture in his face that he has quite the hunger for
these little plants.  His eyes seem to be glowing red as if he
smoked a bit too much of the healing canibus plant.

The home of Falinix~
This is the residence of Falinix, the shopkeeper.  He buys used
and new junk and then sells it back for more than he paid.
(hey little people gots to get paid!)  You can see by his
rather large fingers and bulging belly, this guy has hit the
chuck wagon one time too many.  He is a simple old coot with
barely the strength to pick himself up off the floor.

At the edge of the forest~
You have come to the edge of the forest.  You cannot
seem to travel to the east of here.  The brush and thitch
seems to be too thick to make it.  Your only alternatives are 
to go north, south and west.

goods and black powder.  To the north of here seems
to be a small wetland area.

Near the waterfall~
The waterfall that lies north of here is a very secluded
and strange one.  The water that rushes down and splashes
on your face seems to be very inviting and magicly drawing.
Many of the creatures you have seen so far may not
prepare you for what lies ahead.

A bridge over the river~
You are standing on a very sturdy bridge.  The water flowing
below you is a strange kind of dark blue.  You can tell
it runs deep and cold.  There are many strange creatures
that frolic in these woods.  Some will fear you others will
not care that you are even here.  Watch out for the mighty
underwater grigs.  They have adapted the ability to swim
and breath underwater.  They may pose a threat to you.

At the beach~
You are standing at a very boggy beach.  The sand is
mixed with dirt creating a very sluggish undertow.  This
could be very dangerous indeed.  If you chose to swim out
into this you may encounter some strange looking Grigs.
They look like normal Grigs but with green skin and gills.

Under the waterfall~
You have come under the waterfall.  The feeling here is
so refreshing and clean.  The deep blue water seems to
pour endlessly.  The rocks behind the waterfall seem to 
glow with a bright light.  You will need to be able to
breath water to go any further from here.  You may want
to turn back now.

Under the Blue water~
You have come under the magical waterfall.  The water
seems to hold some kind of magical power.  However,
you will still need to breath like a fish or obtain a magical
helm to breath water down here.  You can see there is
a crack to the north that one could maybe squeeze through.
However, the path leads to the south.
