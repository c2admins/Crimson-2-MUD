Entrance to the Temple of Preservation~
You have stepped into a world totally foreign to the one you just left.  The
white walls surrounding you glow and hum with a life of their own, welcoming
you into the embrace of the Temple of Preservation.  This temple was constructed
long ago by the ancestors of those who built Midgaard in remembrance of all 
those things held sacred to them.  If you tread carefully, you may come across
the great treasures of these ancients and add them to your own wealth.

In the White Corridor~
You walk down a corridor with glowing white walls that hum with a life of their
own.  The walls murmur into your very mind, singing the praises of the earth 
which supports them.  Though they appear at first to be barren white blocks of
marble, the further you walk, the more the walls take on life.  Soon you see
great vistas pass you by, shocking you with their beauty and tempting you to
stop moving and enjoy the sights of mountain peaks and fertile valleys, smells
of fresh earth and streams, and feelings of belonging.

In the Green Corridor~
You are in a corridor with luminous green walls that hum with a life of their
own.  The sounds of the walls eventually merge to sound much like the rustling
of trees in a stiff autumn breeze.  The walls, at a first glance, are made of
green veined stone but the further you go the move convinced you are that they
are not what they seem.  The veins increasingly come together to form the
outlines of leafy canopies offering you the solace of their sound.  You could
easily close your eyes and feel them brush against your face and body as softly
as a lover's fingertips.

In the Red Corridor~
You walk down a corridor with glowing red walls.  These walls give off a heat
that makes sweat pour down your face at the same time as the pictures make your
mind numb with awe.  There are depictions of the sun in all its glory and all
itsguises from dawn to dusk to the full beauty of daylight.  The sun covered 
walls hold you spellbound as the heat warms you to the bone.  Best to keep 
moving though, before it begins to cook you to the bone.

In the Sky~
Your senses try to tell you that you are in a room no larger than average but
your sight betrays you, making this unbelievable.  Your eyes tell you that the
blue walls around you are, in fact, a cloud covered sky and you are standing
on it, in it, embraced by it's freedom.  This place is very special but you
must try to remember that things are not always as they appear and a stairway
to heaven may, in fact, take you straight to hell.

The white walls are covered with murals of all types of wolves in their natural
habitats.  You are enthralled by the high level of craftsmanship in the artwork.
It looks so lifelike that you begin to worry that it could perhaps come to life.

In the Clearing~
You stand in a clearing in the center of a ringe of massive standing stones.  
Four of these huge structures have an odd, perfectly square indentation in them.
There is an altar here where the ancients once called upon great, unknown forces
to join them from the stones.  This too has an odd dent in it, rousing your
curiousity.

Within the Standing Stone~
You are nowhere.  You have stepped through the stone into a dimension of 
nothing.  You stand upon a smooth flat surface that runs as far as you can see
in any direction uninterrupted.
