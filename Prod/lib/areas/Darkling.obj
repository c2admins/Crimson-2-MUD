Schism~
The Great Schism occurred centuries ago.  Before there was a division of red, green and
blue darklings, there lived one group of darklings.  While no color ganging existed, there
was an obvious class division.  An upper class, composed of highly devious and sophisticated
darklings (which became the reds), a middle class composed of enforcers and brute strength
(the eventual blue darklings), and a lower class of farmers and laborers who helped support
the whole nation (the future green darklings).

All was well til the middle class darklings, by far the most ambitious and brutal class, 
decided to take control.  Great civil strife ensued, and the darklings began to identify
friends and foes by the colors they wore.  Chaos was beginning to spread, and all seemed
lost.

The May Queen, Bladdest (the father of Hex), and Cyren (the mentor to Phakir) were determined 
to save the old system by any means possible, and sought to ease the increasing tensions
that were shaking the darkling kingdom.  Then, with no warning, Bladdest died of poisoning,
a sort of poison thought to have been administered by the May Queen.  All attempts at peace
were destroyed, and the land of darklings was plunged...into darkness.
