mob Gothelred jailer~
Gothelred~
Gothelred the Jailer is here chewing on some tobacco.
~
This is a short fat dwarf. He is absolutely filthy, and surrounded by a huge
swarm of flies.  His scraggy beard ought to be white, but has turned a sickly
mixture of pastel shades through lack of care, but no lack of sticky foods.
His clothes are very worn, their lifetime, which really expired long ago, was
probably halved due to them having never been washed once.  His belly hangs
out over his thick black belt, and he spins his keys around his finger merrily
as he walks around here, checking the cells.

The Faceless 
~
Followers of Sha'Tav fear their Lord and believe that only by causing terror
in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath.  They strive to beat down and
suppress all hope.  Fear rules their lives and through fear they rule the lives of
others.  Pain, misery, violence, torture, living sacrifice:  these are the tools 
of a Sha'Tavite.  The Faceless God is a massice bulk of charred flesh and bone, oozing
with decay and giving off a scent of fear.  It swallows all it encounters and its 
shadow makes you feel very cold.

The Plaguebringer
~
Followers of Baal'Nergal believe the only truth in Crimson is that everything
dies.  They view the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate beauty.  The subtle
purples of a fresh bruise, the almost irridescent yellow green of an infested
wound, are but a few of the things His followers relish.  It is not suprising
that most of His followers follow the dark arts.  Do not take this to mean that
His followers are suicidal or seek a quick death.  To the contrary, they wish
to live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased stain across all 
of Crimson.

mob Prince Hate Carr'buth~
&CCarr'buth&n~
The Prince of Hate
~
Followers of Carr'buth include almost the entire Dark Elven race who regard him
as their 'Father.'  They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather 'THE'
creative force in the universe. Creativity born of destruction.  Love and kindness
are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do
what is necessary to obtain it.  It is only through the total disdain of your enemies
thay you will have power over them.  Pity and mercy have no power when
confronted with contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest belief of the 
followers of Carr'buth that if they were to hate strong enough they could
destroy all of Crimson.

The Warlord
~
The followers of Ba'Mahlaht believe in survival of the strong and death to the
weak.  In the heat of battle is the only place where enlightenment can be gained.
The universe was formed in conflict and will end in conflict.  The victors
feasting upon the remains of the fallen enemy.  No respect nor regard is given to
the dead, for if they were worthy their hearts would still pump blood through their
veins and not upon the soil of Crimson.  Followers of Ba'Mahlaht are almost 
exclusively warriors.

mob Platypus~
The &BPlatypus&n of &RPAIN&n~
The &BPlatypus&n of &RPAIN&n is here, swimming playfully in his waterhole.
~
The &BPlatypus&n of &RPAIN&n is here, swimming in his water hole. You have heard about this creature before
in stories from Australians. This is the only mammal that is born from an egg, which is weird in itself.
You get the feeling this creature is not a calm one, as his razor sharp teeth jut out of his mouth, covered in blood.
Maybe you should back away before you get hurt.

mob Zephyr master assassin~
&KZephyr&w, the &cMas&Bte&br Ass&Bas&csin&n ~
&KZephyr&w, the &cMas&Bte&br Ass&Bas&csin &wslinks in the shadows&n
~
  Man or woman? Human or demon? Noone knows who or where Zephyr came from, or how it came to be
what it is, but what is known is that the creature is the perfect assassin. Working for the highest 
bidder, it strikes without warning, always fulfilling a contract. Those who see the beast are usually
too stunned to speak of it...those who cross its path never get that chance.

mob astral dragon mist~
&WM&wis&Wt&n~
A tiny dragon float here, phasing between realities.
~
  Astral dragons are tiny little creatures that exist in both the prime material plane and 
the astral planes of existance. Their bodies are covered in silvery-grey scales that seem
to shift and phase between the two realities. Though they rarely attack, they as ferocious
as any normal dragon when challenged, and should be treated as such.

Though small, Glait is resourceful and possesses great cunning.  She is also loyal to her
mistress.  Be careful not to anger her.

&rRel&W'&rhic&w, guardian and lord of &yMeats &wof &rEvil&n
~
Rel'hic is one helluva luvah!  But he's also quite effective in beating the unholy shite
out of just about anyone.  Like a siren, his bewitching songs lure people into their dooms.
Rather than having nice bosoms, or a bewitching smile, Rel'hic possesses a small heart and
strong hands.  The better to crush you with, my dear.

~

Buckhi, Buckhi, Buckhi.  The Grand Designer foretold the coming of the dreamer.  He who would
mold whole worlds with his warped illusions and twisted fantasies.  A dreamer who would take
the known reality and reverse the established Order.

But Buckhi don't give a damn, no suh.  He prefers to drink da liquor, slap da bitches and
eat dat fine, fine bratwurst.  Oh, and he likes to make blood spill.  Occasionally he'll
mutter such words as "munchy frog, jump testicle, bad mormon." Don't pay that any mind.

He's sexy.

mob bounty master bountymaster~
&yB&Kou&ynt&Ky &yM&Ka&yst&Ke&yr&n~
The &yB&Kou&ynt&Ky &yM&Ka&yst&Ke&yr&n watches your movements carefully.
~
The Bounty Master is a tough, cynical and humorless creature.  Long involved in the arts
of pain, he served initially as an apprentice to Jinipan, seeking the rewards of constant
physical challenge.  His attitude changed as his experience grew, and he effectively grew
to become an opposite of Jinipan - a merciless persecutor, killer and scourge to all who
walked the lands.  Breaking away from Jinipan, the Bounty Hunter hired his skills out and
learned more about death, becoming an employee of the Questmaster and even an emissary of
the Dungeon Master.  Finally the Bounty Master grew satisfied in his abilities and had
developed a reputation - merciless, brutal, successful and perfect.  He tired of his job
eventually, and began to take more interest in watching how others carried out the art 
of murder, and thus started his own business.  He takes great interest in the success and
abilities of others... and is known for rewarding those who do well, and punishing those
who do not.  He is a deadly master, one not to be trifled with.
