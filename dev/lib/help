BOTS

Bots are not illegal here on Crimson 2 but at the same time they are not
encouraged.  For this reason, if you do use a bot then you do so at your
own risk.  If that character is taken advantage of because you are not at
your keyboard to deal with the situations your character is facing, you
will find no support from the immortals.

AUCTION BID
    This help is only temporary.

Syntax: Auction <object> <Min_bid> <Min_raise>
        Bid     <coins>

Where <object>    is the item you want to put up for auction.
      <Min_bid>   is the minimum price you want to sell it for.
      <Min_raise> is the minimum amount of coins they have to
                  raise the current bid with.
      
      <coins>     is the amount of coins you bid for the item.
                  
If you don't supply a <min_bid> or <min_raise>, 0 will be assumed
for these values. For big values you can use points.
Like 150000000 can also be written as 150.000.000

If you don't supply a <coins> for 'bid' then the lowest possible
value will be used (so last bid + raise). 

When you type 'auction' without any values a screen will show you
all the information on the current item being auctioned (if any).

#
DEX
    Dexterity encompasses a number of physical attributes including
hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, precistion, balance, and

one of these attributes is superior, but that the others are very poor.
    1) affects AC bonus

               BONUS = (DEX - 17) * 10   POSITIVELY
           if DEX < 10
               BONUS = (10 - DEX) * 10   NEGATIVELY
           BONUS is zero for all other values.
#
CON
    Constitution is a term which encompasses the character's physique,
fitness, health, and resistance.  Since constitution affects the

    1) affects gaining new hitpoints
        GAIN = CON + (LEVEL / 5) - 5
#
CHA
    Charisma is the measure of the character's combined physical
attractiveness, persuasiveness, and personal magnetism.  It is 
important to all characters as it will affect how aggressive 
mobs attack.  They tend to go for the person with the lowest 
charisma, while sometimes avoiding physical confrontation of those
with a very high charisma.
    By default you can have LEVEL/10 mobs following, with a max
    of 10 total followers.

available which will increase this number.  You can also buy points
from the high priest.
    1) additional move points per level are calculated as follows:
        GAIN = (GET_DEX + (GET_CON / 5) + (LEVEL / 5)) / 3.5
#

#
"SAVING THROWS"
Saving Throws are measures of a character's resistance to special types of 
attacks such as poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind
of the character.  The chance to save is based on the character's level and 
class.  The lower your saving throw, the better.  Saving Throws are classified
into five categories of priority: 
    1) Paralyzation, Poison, or Death Magic  
    2) Rod, Staff, or Wand 
    3) Petrification or Polymorph  
    4) Breath Weapon  
    5) Spell.

Example:
    BattleAxe is struck by the ray of a Wand of Paralyzation.  A save vs. wands
and a save vs. paralyzation would both be appropriate.  However, since save vs. 
paralyzation is a higher priorty than save vs. wand, BattleAxe must save vs. 
paralyzation.

HELLNIGHT HELL
Crimson II sponsors numerous HELLNIGHT events.
Hellnight is a PLAYER-KILLING event. 

The regular player file is removed from play during this time and a blank one
is put in. When you login you may pick any class in the game. Your character
starts out at level 20. Two gods randomly create equipment throughout the
event.
If any character goes to the highpriest and types HEAL they will get a god
restore.
The town is a safe zone and players are not killable inside of it. (although,
you can be summoned out of it if you don't toggle nosummon)

At the end of the Hellnight time limit, the regular mud mode of this mud is

Some areas of interest I've found... Snotlings... 4 west and 5 north of the
market square. Gnomes 4 west and a few steps north and then west... Some 
type of village out the East gate and north at some crossroads.....

I have heard stories of some temple in the woods north of town.. somewhere
to the northwest. Legend tells of some legendary Highpriestess with the 
ability to grant one more stamina and ability.. Maybe I'll try to go there
tomorrow.

Up from the market square lives a maiden of great beauty with a huge heart
known to care for any who visit her.

Here the map ends... it seems our adventurer may have met "something" too
powerful on his way there..
#
DIAG DIAGNOSE
Syntax:  DIAG <player or mob name>
Gives you a rough diagnosis of a player or mob's general health status.

Once you reach level 6 you may type SET FLAG SHOW_DIAG <ON or OFF> to
toggle an indicator in your command prompt that will show the current
health of any mob or player you are fighting. 
#
ALIGN
Alignment ranges from evil to good (-1000 to 1000) Generally on this mud
you will find it more easy to become evil and more hard to become good.
#
DONATE
Donate takes an item in your inventory and puts it in the donation room.
usage: donate sword
Do NOT sell, junk OR auction items in the donation room. To do so is a
serious offense.

See Also: JAIL
#

who tells to you is invisible, you can still reply to them but you will
not be able to see who it is.

See Also:  TELL
#
REPORT
To report your hits, mana, and moves to those in the room with you, simply
type report!
#
GT
gt is the same as group tell. It tells all players in a group a string.
usage: gt <string>
#
BECHO
This command gechoes an info line that is blue (for those who have color)
and should only be used if you really want to grab everyone's attention!
See Also:  GECHO
#
PERSONAL
This flag on an object makes the player unable to drop, donate, or give
the item and makes it impossible for an item to be stolen.
#
ECHO
This is an immortal command which allows the player to 'echo' a string into
the room they are currently located. It's usage is echo <string>. eg; echo 
Grant is cool, would send the string Grant is cool to everybody in the room.
Ante+ gods can use gecho which will send the string to everyone inthe game.
#
SPEEDWALK
Usage is : speed <dir><dir>
Speedwalk is speedwalking through areas. Example : speed ddwnn
#
SET 
Set allows a character to set/uset their flags.
    Example: set flag <flag> <ON of OFF> 
    For a list of all flags, enter: set flag
    Immortals can set a start room with : set start <room number>

#
ANSI

Entering ansi will turn on colors.  If your terminal program supports
colors you will then be able to see the mud through a bright new world
full of bright and dazzling colors.

Entering color will give you a list of the existing colors in whatever
color your terminal program is actually showing them so that you either
know what you are missing out on or can work out fixing them!

See also:  COLORS
#
QUEST_FLAG
Usage:  SET FLAG QUEST <ON or OFF> 
Toggles a quest flag for special questing purposes. 
Such as defending Midgaard or being on a quest.
THE GODS WILL BE UNHAPPY WITH PLAYERS WHO TOGGLE QUEST AND ARE NOT ON QUEST!

See also: QUEST
#
ASSIST
Syntax:  ASSIST or AUTO ASSIST
By entering either of these, you will toggle your assist flag on and off.
When it is toggled on you will help group members immediately when they
attack.  When it is toggled off you will not jump in to assist
automatically in a battle.
#
WIMPY
Syntax:  WIMPY or AUTO FLEE
By entering either of these, you will toggle your wimpy flag on and off.
When it is toggled on you will flee automatically in battles when your hit
points get too low.  When it is toggled off you will not flee during
battles unless you type flee.  If you are raging, wimpy will not work.
#
NOSUMMON 
Syntax:  SET FLAG NOSUMMON <ON or OFF>
This toggles your ability to be summoned on or off.  With this flag on, it
is more difficult for others to summon you.
#
REIMBURSE

    The Ante+ gods can reimburse players.  Reimbursements are only
given for a crash within the mud or a mud problem. If your server
crashes and you lose everything we are sorry but we can not help you.
If you lose link and autorent doesn't save your kit, we are sorry and
can't help you.  Please don't ask because we hate saying no. If you ask
we'll still say no, its that we hate saying it.
    If the mud doesn't crash and you lose an item or two, we will assume
you lost it to player or mob stealing or have accidentally junked them.
If the mud crashes, it is highly unlikely that you will lose only an item
or two and therefore only entire kits will be reimbursed, not a few items.
If you can show there is a bug in the program and the mud is dumping your
item unfairly, we will reimburse and fix the problem.  If you have lost an
item that was changed as a quest prize or hellnight prize, you will only
receive the basic item in your reimbursement, not a changed item.  We
regret that it must be this way but as there are no records kept of
hellnight or quest prizes, there is too much room for some to take
advantage of a formerly bad situation.

If you ask for a reimbustment and are turned down then you may appeal 
as far up as a HighLord, a High's judgement is FINAL. If it needs to 
be taken higher then it will be taken by the High only, so please do
not take it to an Over or IMP yourself, as they have a thousand other 
problems to deal with, (such as the crash that just made you loose your
equipment).

    To recieve a reimbursement add reimbursement to your title as in
Example : title needs a *REIMBURSEMENT*

    We will only reimburse equipment. Not COINS!

See Also: OMAX, TITLE

#
FORCE
This allows you to force a mob or player to execute a command. The usage is
force <target> <command>. eg, force orc bounce would cause the mob, orc, to
bounce around.
Use of this command is allowed for 'humorous' purposes, but care must be taken
not to endanger players if using it for these reasons.
Also, if you are using it for humorous purposes and the target person 
asks you to stop, please exercise some sense and do so.
You cannot force a character higher level then yourself.
Force <all> is limited to Ante+ characters.

#
REBOOT
        The mud is rebooted when new code is installed or when the
    computer is shutdown and restarted.  You'll see a message to the
    left of your prompt with REBOOT_n_MIN.  Where n is a the number
    of minutes before reboot.  The REBOOT_n_MIN prompt appears during
    the last 30 minutes before a reboot.  A message is also sent at 30,
    20, 10, 5, and 1 minute(s).

        As you have plenty of warning, we ask that you avoid getting
    killed just before a reboot.  If you don't get back to your corpse
    before reboot, you'll lose all your items and we would feel bad 
    about that because the donate room will be empty and you'll have
    to kill gnome guards and start rebuilding a kit.

        Usually a reboot is less than 1 minute.   If its going to be
    longer, you'll receive plenty of warning.

        Date/Times are based on Central European time.

See Also: HALT SHUTDOWN TIME

#
SHUTDOWN HALT
        These commands are for terminating the mud, and should be used
    with caution.  To shutdown the system immediately, enter:
           SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE

    To schedule a shutdown at a later time, enter:
           SHUTDOWN n
    where n is a number from 5 to ?? in minutes.   The system will
    automatically count down the minutes and reboot the system.  Users
    will see the following on their prompt line: REBOOT_n_MIN.  A    
    message is sent at 30, 20, 10, 5, and 1 minute(s).
    
    To cancel an automatic shutdown, enter:
           SHUTDOWN 0
          
See Also: REBOOT

#
TRANSFER
This command will move a mob or character from wherever it is in the mud to
where the player is at that time. It's usage is transfer <player/mob>.
You cannot transfer a character higher then yourself.
Transfer <all> is limited to Ante+ chars.

#
GOTO
Avatars and immortals may use this command to move around the mud directly
from one place to another. The target of the goto may be any player, mob or
room number. When this command is used by an avatar, it costs a certain
amount of hits, moves, and mana.(40/40/40) Levels 42+ have unlimited 
usage of this command.

See also: POOFIN POOFOUT

#
VNUM
With this command, immortals may find the number the computer uses to 
identify objects/monsters, usually for the purpose of using the 'load'
command afterwards. The usage is vnum (obj/mob) <keyword>, 
eg; vnum obj cotton would return the line:
    [Virt#] curr.   perc Object Name
    [14123]    50    15 obj cotton overalls 

where [14123] is the object's number, 50 is the number currently in the
game, 15 is the chance percent of the obj resetting,  and obj cotton
overalls are the keywords the item can be called by.

See also: LOAD

#
REROLL

Formerly the fear of every Avatar in the land, the possibility of
rerolling is no longer.  The Gods have looked with favor upon all of their
children.

See Also: FATE

#
POOFIN POOFOUT
    These allow players of level 41 and above to define the messages
    shown to other players when the character uses GOTO to enter a room,
    instead of using the default arrival messages.
             Usage poofin/out <string>.
    eg, poofin drops from the sky, by the character Bird would be seen
        as:
            Bird drops from the sky.
        instead of just Bird appears in a puff of smoke.

    NOTE: You can use $n to position your name.

See also:  GOTO

#
BAN UNBAN
When a site has proved to be a constant source of troublesome players, the
entire site may be banned from accessing the mud using ban.
Ban may be used with the arguments all or new. All will ban the site entirely,
whilst new will allow existing players access, but stop any new characters
being created from that site. The usage is ban <argument> <sitename>.
eg, ban all whitehouse.gov

Unban <sitename> can be used to remove this ban.

#
AT
Immortals may use this command in conjunction with another command, to
'redirect' the other command to the location specified by the 'at'
command. Usage: at <location/mob/character> <command>
eg, at bird smile bird, would smile at the character Bird, wherever in the
game Bird happened to be, not just if he was in the same room.
The most common use would be at 3000 trans Bird which would transfer Bird to
room 3000.

#
SWITCH RETURN

Mortal Usage of Switch : switch victim>

As a mortal skill, this allows the player to redirect their attack upon
another player or mob in the room in the middle of a fight.

Immortal Usage of Switch/Return:

Using this command, immortals may take control of the body of a mob and use
it as if he were playing that mob. The mob will respond as if that is the
imm's actual self. When the player wants to return to his own body, the
return command is used.
Whilst using this command, imms should bear in mind the rules on helping
mortals, and attacking mortals.

See also: IMM_RULES

#
INVIS
This command allows an immortal to set their visibility value. The command
is invis <No> eg. invis 15 would make an immortal invisible to all chars
under level 15. Higher level gods can thus hide from players and lower 
level gods. Vis setting is shown at the left side of your stat bar.
When you are interacting with mortals please be visable to them.

#
SCAN
Scan allows a char to scan for mobs in a dir or it may be used by itself.
Ex: scan <dir> or scan
Immorts can scan <No> <dir> where <No> is the number of rooms to scan.

#
SNOOP
    This command is aimed primarily as an aid to investigating when
players are abusing each other using tells, or other such behaviour,
which cannot be confirmed by other means. Usage is snoop <target>, and
the imm will see everything the mortal see's and types in, preceeded by
a %. When snoop is no longer required, it may be halted by 'snooping'
yourself, ie snoop <your name>.
    This command can be easily abused, and players must ensure they do
not do so. Any infringments of this will be stricly dealt with.

    For everybody's clarification. Snoop is intended for use in watching
people who you think may be rule breaking mainly.  It can also be used
from time to time for one or two other reasons, HOWEVER, it is not
acceptable and will be viewed as an abuse of power if you are snooping
simply to eavesdrop on somebody's conversation.  Also if you do snoop
somebody and then have to step in and tell them something, you are NOT
to be invisible when dealing with the player.

If you are snooping legitimately and overhear something personal, you
are not to act on it, and CERTAINLY not to comment, or anything like
that.  Snoop is for business only.

See also: IMM_RULES

#
CRASH
    Despite our best efforts, sometimes something goes wrong and the
mud crashes.   This means the program stops executing and you see:

        Connection closed by foreign host.
    
    Crashes are not intentional and we'll do our best to get it fixed.

See also: SAVE  REIMBURSE

#
NOHASSLE
   When on, aggressive mobs won't attack you.

#
SNOWBALL
This is a special social command available to immortals.

See also: SOCIALS

#
PKILLABLE

To enter into the realm of pkilling on Crimson II, you must attain the
level of 20 and seek out an Implementor+ to set the pkillable flag on for
you.  With this flag on, you may kill others with the flag.  Everyone who
has the flag set on has a red <PK> beside of their name in the who 
list..Once this flag is set it can not be removed.

Pkilling still has some constraints, outlined in PKILLING and PERSECUTION.  

See also:  PKILLING PERSECUTION

#
PKILLING
Last updated 05/05/98

On Crimson II we allow players to Pkill other players.  To enter
into the pkilling aspect of the game, you must attain at least
level 20 and ask an Implementor+ to set the flag for you.  However due
to some players persecuting players they don't like, we have established
some rules which still must be followed.

  - Immortals/Gods may not kill players.
  - Avatars can kill Avatars. If you do this preferably be away from a mort.
  - Avatars may kill morts, and vice versa. Avatars are expected to show
    maturity in this respect.
  - A player MAY NOT be killed if they do not have the pkillable flag
    (identifiable by the <PK> by their title in the who list).  If you
    have a problem, contact a god.  There is coding that SHOULD protect pc's
    without the pkillable flag.  Any form of manipulation of a pc by any
    means to cause them death is illegal unless both players have the <PK>
    flag.
  - If someone is provoking you into assaulting them to make you look like your
    persecuting, tell a ANTE+ char to snoop the offending player or
    yourself.  If the ANTE+ see's it he/she will take care of it.
  - Pkilling with a charmed mob is illegal. Period.
  - If you want to summon someone and pkill them, YOU summon them.
    Summoning a player to be killed by someone else is illegal.
  - When you pkill someone you are allowed to take ONE item from their
    corpse, if and ONLY if that person has the pkillable flag and you
    have the pkillable flag.  If the corpse is gone before you loot, bad 
    luck.

Generally, just use common sense when you pkill someone. Don't persecute them.
Kill them once and drop the grudge.

An arena 1 down from the Market Square has been installed.  Anybody can
pkill or be pkilled here, regardless of what flags they have.


Note: If you happen to make someone mortally wounded and you leave it that
      way you are able to steal worn equipment, only one piece is allowed
      though.

SEE ALSO: PERSECUTION

#
PERSECUTION
We have had problems with player persecution... We define persecution rather
laxly on Crimson.  If you are Pkilling a char every time they log in with your
mort or multi's we are generally going to call that persecution. If a character
comes to us and complains that you are multiple killing them, we are going to
call that persecution too. (If we find out that is true).
Players DO NOT have a "right to Pkill" anyone they want when they want to.
Pkilling is GENERALLY done when someone either pisses you off or you need 
a piece of equipment from their kit.  If someone accuses you of persecuting 
them,  we will figure out the situation.  The Immortal/God will decide 
your fate based upon what the circumstances are and make a reasonable
decision.  You can appeal decisions up to the Highlord level.  The highlords
decision is final and you must abide by it. 

Example:

  Bird kills Robin during a session.   Robin logs back on, Bird kills Robin
  again.  This happens several more times.  Robin screams persecution.  Morgan,
  a Highlord, pulls both Bird and Robin aside and asks why.  It is found that
  Robin has been TAUNTING Bird repeatedly.  Morgan decides to let both 
  characters go.  And tells Robin to stop irritating Bird.  If she does it again
  she will be jailed.  If Bird Pkills her again he will be jailed. 

  - Pkilling someone with a multi will count toward your total pkilling score.
    (ie I kill someone with my char Death, then the same character with my char
     Stalker, I will have pkilled that character twice and be subject to
     persecution enforcement.)
  - If an Immortal asks you if someone is your multi you MUST tell them.
    Ignoring them will only get you into BIG trouble.  They may take certain
    steps to insure that the char is your multi.

*  Do NOT think to persecute one and all on Crimson 2.  If your goal is   *

RULES_1 RULES

See help RULES_2 and RULES_3 as well.
We the Administrators here at CrimsonMud II want everyone to have a good 
time and get everything possible out of their Mud experience.

The immortal structure on this mud is as follows, from lowest to highest,
and any queries should be aimed at the lower levels first, and if they
are unable to helpyou or are non-responding, you may ask a higher level.

The Wiztitles on 'who' are:
---------------------------
Level
  42        [----Arch-----] Arch-Avatar.
  43        [---Legend----] Legend.
  43        [---Creator---] Creator.
  44        [----Meth-----] Methuselah.
  45        [----Ante-----] Antedeluvian.
  46        [----High-----] Highlord.
  47        [----Over-----] Overlord.
  48        [-----IMP-----] [----CODER----] [----QUEEN----] Implementor.
  49        [-----GOD-----] GOD character (boss)
  49        [-- The Law --] Kinetic, The Guy in Charge.

In general, we try to promote players excercising common sense, but 
unfortunately, we have found that this is not realistic in some cases, 
and so have had to lay down a number of rules.

You MUST listen to the Immortals/Gods. If they tell you something LISTEN
to them.  If you do not agree with the decision you MAY appeal to a higher
Immortal/god.  However, you'll find that in most cases if the decree is
reasonable, it will be enforced.  The word of Highlords+ is law and if
your appeal is denied, accept the decision.

All Immortals are to be treated with respect.  Each rule has some room for
error within it and the Immortals must interpret them.  The Immortals of
Crimson II volunteer their time and effort to make the place more fun and
interesting for everyone.  Should you be found unable to treat the Imm
staff with the respect they are due, you will find yourself in jail to
reconsider.

#
RULES_2 

see help RULES and RULES_3 as well
If something seems like it might be stretching the rules...dont do it, even
if it is not expressly stated in the rules that it is 'illegal'.  If people are
not constantly 'stretching the rules' we can focus on other things to make the
Mud a better place.  Treat these rules as a guideline and we will all be ok.

* Player Killing IS legal on Crimson for more information on this enter:
      HELP PKILLING.
  
* Player Stealing is not legal at Crimson mud, unless your PKILLABLE flag
  is set.  (See help PKILLABLE)

* Summoning agressive mobs to places where they might kill anyone but you is
  illegal. (try to imagine how you would feel after a 5 hour marathon which
  raised your character to the pinnacle of 10th level, only to be killed just
  outside the inn by Gargath, Lord of Tarterus....). This includes summoning
  a player to somewhere they may be killed by mob or pkiller (unless the
  summoner IS the pkiller).

- First Offense:  Warning by an Immortal, made to kill the mob, or made to
                  compensate the mortal for his loss of exp mortal.
- Second Offense: Jail for a Week.
- Third Offense:  Purging of your kit, and a month in jail.

* Stealing other players 'kills' is illegal.  If another player is
  fighting a mob DON'T kill the mob.  Also if someone is in a room with a
  mob ask if it's their mob before killing it.  

- First Offense:  Warning by an Immortals, made to give the gold or eq to
                  the player who's mob it was,
- Second Offense: Jail for a Week, made to give the gold or eq to the player
                  who's mob it was.
- Third Offense:  Jail for a month, entire kit given to the player who's mob
                  it was, and the gold from killing the mob.

* Sharing of characters, selling of characters, or giving of characters is
  illegal.  Any offense is punishable by deletion of the character
  involved, the highest multis of the people involved, and possible
  deletion of any imm multis of the parties involved.

#
RULES_3

(see RULES_1 and RULES_2 as well)
* Donation room eq is just that.  Donated equipment.  If it's in there then
  anyone can come in and do WHATEVER they want with it.  The ONLY exception is
  a corpse.  Some people will donate corpses so that you get them back without
  running to the site you died in.  If this happens you may NOT take items off
  the corpse.  HOWEVER, donator's do this at your own risk.  If the corpse
  decays, and the equipment is on the ground, then the equipment is classified
  as DONATED equipment.  Which means if your corpse is in there and decays and
  a newbie walks in and picks up your Sword of Glory or Chaos Rings... tough
  luck!  Beg with them, plead with them, realize that it is perfectly in
  the rules for them to keep the equipment.  (So usually harrassing them
  isn't a wise idea)
  Other limitations are that you may NOT sell/junk/or auction donated eq.

- First Offense:  Warning by an Immortal, made to give back cash and eq gained
                  this way.
- Second Offense: Purging of kit, 1 week in jail, gold set to 0.
- Third Offense:  Purging of kit, One month in jail, all gold set to 0.

NOTE:  A disrespectful attitude will get you nowhere.  If you can't
       treat an Imm with respect, you may be left in jail to cool
       down.  All of these rules have room for interpretation.  The
       Immortal(s) on-line will make an initial ruling.  If for some
       reason you do not think that your judgment was fair, seek a
       Highlord to look over your case.  The Highlord will pass a
       judgement and this judgement may not be appealed to any other
       immortal.  In truly severe cases (and ONLY truly severe cases)
       Kinetic may choose to pass his judgement on a situation.  The
       listed penalties are only guidelines, but should be adhered to. 

Once again we are trying to make this Mud a fun place to be for everyone. 
If we all try to get along as much as possible and respect each others
right to play more or less hassle free, this place will run smoothly.

APPEALS
In some cases, people who have been penalized for breaking a rule believe
that they have grounds for appeals.  Should you feel that you want to
appeal a decision made regarding yourself, make sure that you remember the
name of the immortal who judged your case!

Decisions made by an immortal can be appealed to an immortal of a higher
level than that immortal (not the same level, only higher) until you reach
the level of the Highlord.  At this point a different protocol must be
followed.

The decisions of a High+ immortal may be appealed only directly,
preferably via email, to Kinetic.  If a Highlord has presided over your
case or your appeal, you may NOT take it to another High, Over, or Imp and
you may not take it to an immortal of a lower level as they can not over
rule a High.

SHARING PSHARING PGIVING

It is highly illegal to share, give away, or sell your characters
on Crimson.  To do so will result in immediate deletion of the character
involved, deletion of the highest level characters of the people involved,
and possible deletion of immortal multis of the people involved.
#
LOOTING

Looting of other players corpses when they die is against mud rules.
If caught your character will be punished.

Looting of equipment and cash off mobs that someone else kills is also
against the rules and will be treated as though you looted a players corpse. 

The only example in which looting is allowed is under the PKILLING regulations. 
One (1) piece of equipment may be taken by the pkiller

CLAN
All existing help files on clans are still in draft form.  Please keep
this in mind and read over them again before you apply!

On Crimson 2, your clan status depends on two things, which clan you are
a member of, and what rank you are in that clan. You can only be a
member of one clan at a time. Each clan has its own rules, requirements
joining restrictions and themes, we suggest you choose one you like by
looking at the descriptions provided for each clan, and by talking to
its members. To apply to join a clan, you must be level 10 or greater.
Each clan may have a minimum acceptance level, so always check the clan
description.

  rules of the mud.

* The clan leader(s) are responsible for all members.  If a member(s)
  breaks rules and the situation within the clan isn't handles correctly,
  the clan may be suspended. IE, Phoenix a high ranking member of Sloth
  clan decides to break a few rules, and gets caught. If clan does nothing
  to punish Phoenix with-in the clan for disrupting the rules of the
  world, it might put the clan in jeopardy. Clans are an exercise in
  role-playing, as well as a feature of the mud,

* If a clan chooses to purchase a clan house, no member of the clan may
  leave keys of any kind anywhere in the clan house.  A first offense is 
  punishable by purging of the clan donation room and any other room in
  the clan house that is stocking items.  A second offense will be
  punished by disabling the clan for 1 week.  A third offense will be 
  punished by the permanent disabling of the clan which no money may

18. In a short paragraph describe what being an immortal means to you.

19. In a short paragraph describe why you want to be an immortal.

20. Finally do you work, go to school, both, neither.  If so, do
    you think this could hinder your time on the mud much?

IMMORTALS

** LESSER IMMORTALS **
ARCH
   The Arch-Avat (Arch) is the first level of true immortality on
Crimson mud. They are in a level of training for Meth in most cases,
so please be patient if they cannot help you right away.
They may be approached for rules clarification or help with
basics of the mud or mudding.

LEGEND
   The Legend is the next stage of immortality.  These immortals are those
who have worked or played on Crimson mud in the past but, by time and
other duties have sadly been unable to maintain their duties in other
positions.  When they are around, these immortals can be helpful, just
ask.  Their position is one of honor and as such, they deserve just as
much respect as all other immortals.

The legends in existence today are:

                             Ise    Phelan
             Cunny     Rawhead     Troppo    Darth     Taco  
       Lambchop     Cryogen     Croaker     Kalin     Chani     Rlum

	And ofcourse     !!!!!!!! O D I N !!!!!!!!!!

CREATOR
   The Creator is a Legend who has created at least one zone which has
been installed on Crimson mud.  Don't forget though, many of the immortals
of higher levels also have the credentials of the Creator!

The creators in existence today are:

             Perna     Sorrow     Blaze     Bolt     Darkgrin

** IMMORTALS **
METHUSELAH
    The Methuselah (Meth) is the next truly active immortal level, and is
where the majority of those imms who express an interest in helping to
run the mud, are positioned.  These immortals have the powers to
perform basic law enforcement, assist the implementation of quests and such.
They are the first liason between the players and the higher Gods as well.
    A meth should be the first one approached if there is a problem on the Mud.
If he/she cannot fix the problem, they will notify someone who can.  Please
contact them if you have a problem before you go to a higher immortal.

** HIGHER IMMORTALS **
ANTE ANTEDELUVIAN
    The Antedeluvian (Ante) are the next step if the METH can't
settle a dispute. They also have more powers to enforce the rules. 
They are able to reimburse equipment if the situation calls for it.

** LESSER GODS **
HIGHLORD
    HighLords are second only to the Overlord and have almost as much power.
A HighLord's word is LAW and should be treated accordingly, in other words, when
a HighLord makes a ruling, it is final.  A High is the onethat usually steps in 
when rules are broken that need a more diplomatic solution. 

** GODS **
OVERLORD
    The Overlord shadows the mud and make sure Immortals/Lesser Gods are keeping
up with their jobs.  The Overlord is the head of the Immortals.  They also 
receive responsibiy and abuse for anything which goes wrong.

** HIGHER GODS **
Coder:
    These are the programmers responsible for coding the mud. 
In addition to this difficult task, these people are always looking out for
both the mortals and immortals of the mud, often assuring from behind the
scenes that every day mud life progresses smoothly and fairly.  These
poor down trodden souls work for hours on end trying to make the mud
environment a friendly one.  Always searching for a kind word, they are
sometimes reduced to coding various traps such as a lightning strike so 
they'll know their efforts are being noticed, if not gleefully welcomed.

Implementors: 
     This is the person who goes over all the details of the mud, enforcing 
rules to a greater degree, and keeps up on all of the logs.  This person is the 
frontperson of THE BOSS, and takes the flack when he's not around. 

** THE BOSS **
   This guy makes the rules.  His job is to take flack, look tough, and laugh
at the people moaning.  You should contact him if you want to create a zone.
He is very busy making the mud an exciting place, so if you have trouble
contacting him, leave a message.   For all other issues, and whenever possible,
work your way up the chain of command.

IMM_RULES
    These rules are for players of Arch-Avatar rank and above. Avatars 
have their own set of specific regulations. (Help AVATAR)  We do hope 
that most of this is common sense to those of you who have progressed 
this far.  There is 1 basic rule that you must follow, the rest of 
this list is just an extension of this.
       
       Do not do anything with your immortal that will in any way
       affect the gameplay of mortals.  The only exception to this 
       being authorized quests.  You may not use your immortal to
       explore areas or skills your mort does not have.


         1.  Do not kill mortals or mobs. And dont think that transferring
             or summoning them to aggressive mobs doesn't count.
         2.  Do not use your immortal to assist mortals in gaining  
             knowledge, gold, equipment, or anything similar.  Players may
             be given simple directions, usually newbies to newbie areas,
             but that is all.   Other than the following exception, ARCH,
             LEGEND, CREATOR, METH, and ANTE are NOT to restore or cast
             spells on mortals. The exception is when you are actively
             helping a level one learn how to mud.  In this case you can
             cast STRENGTH, AID, and SANCTUARY on the newbie.  When the
             character reaches level two, that character must get along
             without additional spells. We aren't heartless and if a
             player is dying, you can cast heal on them.  Don't make it a
             habit. Sometimes it requires dying to get the message across
             The restriction on knowledge doesn't mean you can't teach a
             player how to mud.  
           **This also includes not giving out the sites of other mudders. 
          ***This also applied to information on ANY Immortal Board.

IMM_RULES2
         3.  Do not use trans or summon to move mortals to mobs or mobs to
             mortals.  After all they do have legs.  Let them walk or run.
         4.  Do not give out free equipment.  Only ANTE+ may reimburse players.
         5.  If you want to visit someone and it doesn't involve saving their
             butts from combat or being lost you may move them to a safe spot
             to talk.   Even if a newbie is lost, let them get a summon or find
             a recall on their own.  Its a lesson better learned at an early 
             age.
         6.  Immortals are not allowed to have equipment. *within reason*
             Once you imm you are required to goto the dump and drop all 
             your eq in it. If you ask a HIGH+ you may carry a kit just for
             looks. (ie.. a gown and sandals) Imms may not carry equipment
             that is top eq  without permision from an OVER+  NOTE:  You can
             set your description to make it appear you are wearing a kit.
         7.  Archs, Legends, Creators, and  Meths may not have their
             mortal characters on at the same time as their immortal,
             apart from in exceptional circumstances, which must be approved by
             a High+. Ante's may, but if you are playing your mort we 
             respectfully ask that you make your imm character WIZ INVIS.
         8.  Do not use your immortal to explore zones or stat items and mobs,
             even if you have encountered them as a mortal unless there 
             is a need for that information.  Do not use your immortal to
             stat players for your own use.
         9.  Archs may have small supervised quests to help them adjust to
             the difficulty level of quests allowed and prizes fitting.
             Meths can have small quests unsupervised.
        10.  Arch, Creator, Legend, and Meth have no reason to cast any
             spells apart from quest prizes.  Doing so in any case is
             illegal but casting any offensive spell or spell that creates
             a weapon will result in immediate deletion.
        11.  As an immortal, you must drop all affiliations with clans with
             your immortal.  You may not be a member nor a particular
             advocate for any particular clan any more than any other clan.
        12.  You may not share nor sell your immortal character.
        13.  NOBODY is above the rules.
       
         *   If you are unsure of anything, ask. Don't just stumble along.

ARCH-AVATAR ARCH

The Arch-Avatar is a very important level for getting into the ranks of
immortality.  If you choose to give up your Avatar to join into these
ranks, all of your worldly goods shall be given up and you must enter
wholly into your journey to find your place.  Nobody advanced to Arch will
get their Avatar back for any reason.

AVATAR (level 41)
Avatars are semi-immortals. They have climbed the ranks of mortal man, and now
roam the world as monuments of perfection.  Once you reach the level of Avatar
you gain some minor god commands and can still adventure, but ONLY under
the defined rules.  You may either continue to adventure like this, building
your character up tougher and tougher. Once you reach this level you may
possibly become a full immortal (See: IMMORTAL) by one of two ways at this
time. 1) By asking a High+ who will then take your request up to be 
considered, or 2) you will be approched by a higher immortal who sees your 
contributions to the mud and use of good sense and asks for you to join.
 
    NOTE:  Advancing to ARCH is an irreversible step, and you cannot continue
           to adventure.  For no reason will your avatar be reimbursed.
           Refer to HELP_IMMORTAL.

        Avatars do not get *ALL* skills/spells upon reaching AVATAR
    level.  They must use the SET CLASS <class> command and begin at
    level one in that class and progress to the point where they gain
    skills/spell for that class.  They can swap between classes but must
    always begin at level one.
        WARNING:  If an Avatar changes their class before practicing all
    spells/skills to a minimum proficiency of 1, they lose the ability to
    practice them until such time as they return to that class and gain
    experience which would allow them to practice it again.   Experience
    is set to 1 even if its the class you Avatared in.
                  Because you are training for the new class you assume
    the THAC0 of the new class.

RULES:
     We expect you to be mature enough that you won't use your powers
to abuse mortals via pkilling.  Its also requested that you use common
sense when helping mortals level. You are still bound by the persecution 
rules in HELP PKILLING.

#
ZONELORD
Zonelords are people who are creating new zones for the mud.  They have been
granted special priveliges in their respective area(s) to enable them to
do this. On the rest of the mud they are normal characters of their level.

If you want to contribute toward CrimsonMud, the best and most common way is
to create a zone.  To create a zone you must have a character at least 
avatar level in the game, and you need a reasonably original idea, that 
fits in with the rest of the mud... futuristic zones and the like will
not be accepted.

Once you have decided what you aim to do with a zone, email the details to
Bingo at &pBingo_the_dog@hotmail.com&E or on mud mail so that he can 
consider the proposal. 
The idea may be rejected, with reasons given and possibly suggestions for
changes that would get the idea accepted, accepted straight away or I may
ask you for more information.
Before you will be given a blank zone to work with, you must have a clear
idea of what you aim to achieve.  It is perfectly acceptable to alter things
as you go along, but you should not start from scratch with no idea of what
you are going to do.  Also except for special cases, your zone should fit 
within 100 rooms, 100 mobs (it is rare for a zone to use more than about 30)
and 100 objects (again, it is rare for a zone to need even close to 100).

Once you have had an idea accepted, you will be given a blank zone on the
development port to work with, and instructions on how to use the online
creation facilities.

At this time we do not have any doc files on how to produce area files
off-line.  We have added lots of new flags and fields since the original
doc files were written, and the existing doc files are now defunct.
The reset file however DOES have a doc file, explaining how to write it
off-line, however it too can still be written online.

Restrictions:
Zonelords may NOT adventure in their zone for three weeks after their
zone becomes available for the general public.  This includes ALL
characters owned by the player with the zonelord.

The zonelord and his/her other multies not use equipment from the zone even if
someone else goes to the zone to get it, during this same period of time.

The zonelord is not allowed to tell others about the zone.  Do not give guided
tours or tell others (mortal or immortal) about any items, mobs, rooms, etc.

Note, the zones designed here effectively become the property of the mud.  We
will of course give you copies of your files if you wish them, to do with as
you wish, however we reserve the right to keep the zone on this mud, even if
you should decide to leave.

#
SNEAK

Thieves Only.

When you type sneak, there is no way to know if you actually sneak. If you
sucessfully sneak, then you'll continue to sneak for a little while.

Example:

  > sneak

See Also: HIDE

#
HIDE

Thieves Only.
When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room. If hidden
you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell.  Even if sensed your
identity will remain hidden. Hide is broken by pressing return, regardless
of wherther you typed a command or not.

Example:

  Ok.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  >  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)

#

AC "ARMOR CLASS"

Is your armor class, it is defined roughly as follows:

  400 Naked person
    0 Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -400 Armored battle tank

  There are some really gross ac items out there.   If you have an
  ac under -400 or over 400, your ac will be set to +400.  Mearly
  tell an immort about the bad item and a new one will be provided
  as a replacement.  A message is printed if your ac is adjusted so
  you'll know what is happening.

#
OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK
Usage (example):
 > open portal
or
 > open portal to the south
   (if there's more than one to choose from)

#
NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN

will not see them on the who list.

Note: who accepts a name argument to display the real name of chars with $n's
      hiding their name type WHO NAME to see their true names.  
      who accepts min and max lvl arguments. WHO 10 20
      WHO CLAN shows displays the real name and the clan they are in.

#
GIVE
If you feel benevolent, you may give some stuff to someone in need. Example:
give bread to the beggar.

we gave bread. If giving coins the xample is give <amt> coins <name>.
Example: give 10 coins Bird

#
SAVE
    Save your persona. This includes experience points, strength, gold,
etc.   NOTE:  Any equipment you may have gathered is NOT saved. 

    HIGH+ have the option of entering "SAVE ALL".  This is useful, when
a possible crash is thought to be imminent.  The "ALL" option saves all
character data and items so that any recently made gains are not lost.

#
STRING
For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

#
LOAD
For loading new objects or characters from the database. The format is:
load <type> <number>
Where <type> is either 'obj' or 'char', and number is the number of the object
or character you wish to create.

#
ALIAS
    FORMAT: alias
                 To get a list of alias commands.
            alias <command> <action1;action2;action3;...>
                 To set/replace an alias command
                 Use a ';' to perform multiple commands.
            alias <command>
                 To remove an alias.

    You can define an alias:
        Example: alias gbb get bread bag
    Alias's can be strung out by separating aliases with a ;
        Example: alias gbb get bread bag ; eat bread
        The above would both get bread from a bag and eat it.
    You can also use $* as a positional field for arguments to the alias.
        Example: alias heal cast heal $*;diag $*
        The above would do the following if you enter: heal SunShine
             cast heal SunShine
             diag SunShine
    Alias <alias name> without an argument after it will delete the
    alias.

    Note:  Do to scheduling, some commands such as attacks and spell
           casting might not occur in the order in which you have them
           defined in the alias.  This is not a bug and you need to
           experiment to find what works.

#
FATE

Fate has been blissfully removed from Crimson II, and replaced with a
counter which counts the number of times you have been killed!

#
SAY TELL WHISPER ASK
If you consider communicating with other beings, you need to start 
your sentences with either say,tell,whisper or shout.

       Example : say I can kill sly with a long sword.
	         tell Kalin I want turn in my cookie!    

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:
            ' hello there.

Note: these are now sensitive to ".","?", "!", "&", ")" and "("'s. When
you use them you state, question, exclaim, sing and say happily and sadly.

#
QUI SHUTDOW
Just to prevent accidental quittings and/or shutdowns.
This command doesn't DO anything, it simply is.

#
TOP
There are three top 20 lists which can be viewed using the top command.
These are scores, kills, and deaths.  Type score to see your score (Your
kills/death score is : ) or attribute to see your kills and deaths values
(victims and rotting corpses).

    Usage:  top <list> 
    Available lists:  scores, kills, deaths

Your kills/death score is calculated based upon your level and the levels
of every mob you kill.  When you kill a mob, if you are a lower level
than the mob, your level is subtracted from the level of the mob and this
value is multiplied by 5.  To this number is added 10 and the final value
is added to your kills/death score.  

If you are of the same level or a higher level than the mob, then your
level is subtracted from the level of the mob and 10 is added to this
number.  The value is then added to (or subtracted from!) your kills/death
score.  Therefore, you will never lose more than 10 points of your
kills/death score with one kill.

It is all terribly complicated of course, but it boils down to the fact
that you get more points for killing mobs higher level than yourself than
you get for killing mobs lower level than yourself and if you kill mobs of
too low a level you may even lose points!
#
KILL HIT
A good way to start a fight.

#
SLASH PIERCE BLUDGEON 
Another good way to start a fight.

See Also KILL, SKILLS

#
PARRY 
   This skill automatically kicks in if you will be damaged by an amount
more than your current hit points.  

#
KICK
Fighter class types only. 
The success of a kick depends upon how well you have learned the skill.
The higher level you reach the harder you kick. There is one small catch -
whenever you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for
three rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee!

Fighters See Also : Rescue, Bash

#
BASH
    The success of a bash depends upon two things.
         1) Your skill in bashing.
         2) The victim's dex and difference between your
            level and victim's level.   For example, A newbie would
            find it impossible to bash a level 40 mob.  
    To bash someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you
succeed you will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on
it's rear. The victim will be unable to issue any commands/fight for 2
rounds of violence. If you miss you loose your balance and fall.
    A bash makes you unable to type commands/fight for 2 rounds of
violence.

Fighters See Also : RESCUE, KICK

#
RESCUE
Fighters types only.
A rescue is an attempt to make a monster hit you instead of the person being
rescued. You can only 'turn' one monster for each attempt. This is highly
useable when playing in groups.

#
STEAL

Thief only.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires at least 1,250 XP
points to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters
at all levels.


Example:

> steal gold drunk

> steal sword mercenary
  (only possible if he is sleeping)

#
BACKSTAB

Thief only, unless the victim is asleep.

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place you dagger in his
back, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful backstab
gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:

LEVEL       MULTIPLIER
 1-4            2
 5-9            3
10-14           4
15-19           5
20-24           6
25-29           7
30-34           8
35-39           9
  40            10
  41            11
	

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild. You can always backstab sleeping
persons.

#
CAST
For "magical" people. If you want to throw a spell at someone or something.
Example : cast 'burning hands' <player>
   Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by single quotes!!!
Single word spells can be cast without quotes. Example : cast heal Bird
Spells can also be cast by the spell number seen when you type practice.
Example:  cast 4 <target> will cause blindness to be cast upon the target.

See also : help on each individual spell, for example:
  > help cure ligh
  > help ventri
  > help energy drain

#
DROP
If you lose interest in a carried item, you can drop it on the ground.
Example : drop bottle
  If you feel like getting rid of all your earthly possessions, you may use
"drop all".

See also: GET

#
PURGE

Usage:

  purge <character>             To remove a living thing. Kicks out a player.
  purge <object>                to remove an object.

#
STATS

    For information on your stats, use the following commands:      

     SCORE      ATTRIBUTE      SPELL    ALIAS

    You can also get help on the above commands and the following, by
    entering HELP <word>

     STRENGTH   INTELLIGENCE   WISDOM   DEXTERITY   CONSTITUTION
     CHARISMA   MOVE           MANA     WISDOM 

#
ORDER

In bars etc you can order things.

    You can also order charmed mobs to perform commands.  For example,
                 ORDER GUARD SING.
    An optional format,
                 ORDER FOLLOWER <command>
    will cause all charmed followers to perform the command.

#
BUY SELL
Commands for the shops - very useful too !
Note: on this mud these can be combined with a quantity. Example :

#
WEATHER
If you're uncertain whether the sun is shining or the rain is pouring down.
If a storm is brewing, beware, you may be struck by lightning if you are
not careful and that can have dire consequences!

See Also: BOARDS
#
REMOVE
If you tire of wearing some armor or wielding a weapon.
Example : remove sword
Note: remove all will remove everything!
#
SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

#
PRACTICE PRACTISE PRACS
   Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good 
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practice a certain amount
for each level you gain.   Practicing requires practice points which 
you gain as you level.

    A guildmaster can only teach you to 60% proficiency.  You have to
gain additional skill via actual use.  You might or might not gain
proficiency before 60%, but you'll have to learn that on your own.

See also: SKILLS, WISDOM
#
EXITS
Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course, the less
obvious ones won't show up here - you have to THINK in order to locate those.
#
LEAVE
If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.
#
ENTER
If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you'll enter any nearby shelter.
You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for example, 'enter window'.
#
TIME
Gives you the current 'gametime'.  Your initial reaction to the output
of this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.
You'll have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend
on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for
 example.
   Note: Also displays game uptime and Central European Time.

#
BUG TYPO IDEA
For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. Examples:
typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'
When you use this command, the room you are standing in is reported so if
the typo is in the room, then you need be no more specific.  However, if
you have found a typo in a mob, object, or help file, you have to try to
be more descriptive.

Bug and idea provide more room for you to describe the problem/idea.  For
example typing 'bug game crashes' will bring up an editor that will let
you write one line at a time a description of the bug you have found.
Typing 'idea food' will bring up an editor that will let you write one
line at a time a description of your ideas concerning Crimson cuisine.
 
#
QUIT
When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
Note that all of your items will be stored except for no rent items and
you will enter the game next at the spot where you quit but there are some
areas from which you cannot quit, you have to cut your link and wait for
your character to autorent (autoquit these days).

#
INN INNS
Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you may use inns to store your
gathered equipment while you are not playing the game (we all have to sleep
sometimes, there is no shame in that).

This mud does not require you to rent, you simply have to quit but we
still maintain the atmospheres of the local inns!

See also: OFFER, RENT, QUIT
#
OFFER RENT
For use in the receptions of inns. The command 'offer' will make the innkeeper
tell you the cost of storing your character for different amounts of time
but it really doesn't make much difference as you can't rent anyway!

Besides, why would you want to?  Just type quit all of your items which
are not no_rent will be stored for you to come back and play another day!

See also: INN, QUIT
#
GET TAKE
If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick it
up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if you just feel very
greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use 'get' to extract objects from
containers. Example: "get dagger from bag".

See also: DROP PUT
#
PUT
For putting stuff in containers. Example: "Put the dagger in the bag".

See also: GET
#
EXAMINE
May give you some valuable information about an item.

See also: LOOK
#
WRITE

a pen of some sort. You can then type something like "write on the paper with
the pen", whereupon you'll be asked to type in your note at the keyboard.

See Also: BOARDS
#
NEWS
This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD Herald", a
publication dedicated to news and useful information about this world. It's a
very good idea to check it out once in a while.
#
SLEEPING WAKE REST SIT STAND
For changing your position. If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea to sit
and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap. Wake will automatically awaken
and stand your character up.
#
POUR FILL
If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another.
for example:
              pour foutain barrel
              fill barrel from fountain
#
GRAB
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE
#
FOLLOW
If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why not 
simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are following 
someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you've got to do is follow 
yourself: "follow <your name>".
#
FLEE
If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto! you are out of harm's 
way - that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't 
simply bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live 
forever?
#
EMOTE
This command is for any social's you may want to use, which are not actually
implemented as a separate social command, as listed in help social.

It's usage is simply: emote <string>
eg; emote feels cheerful,  typed by the character Zeon would be seen as:
Zeon feels cheerful, to everybody in the room.

Also, you may use the characters $n in the string, and your name will be
placed here instead of at the start of the message.
eg; emote A large piano drops onto $n and squashes him flat, would be seen as
A large piano drops onto Zeon and squashes him flat.

#
IMPLEMENTOR

Is responsible for coding the mud. In addition to this difficult task,
this person is always looking out for both the mortals and immortals of
the mud, often assuring from behind the scenes that every day mud life
progresses smoothly and fairly.  This person can just do about anything mud
related, but request that you seek day by day help from the other immortals
and Gods as altering the world is a time consuming and weary business.

GUILD
The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTICE
#
INFO
Gives you some useful hints and information about the game.
#
WHERE
Tells you the location of a monster, a player or an object. Examples:

where dragon    
      tells you where dragons are.
where 3022
      tells you where long swords are located.
where OBJ <object>
      tells you where objects are located.

    Mortals can only "where" monsters or players, and only from their
own zone.  Immortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where 
everybody is.   Ante and above can type where <number> to see where all
objects of that number are located.
    A caution when using "where" by an imm. You can spam yourself into 
linkdeath.  Example:
    where guard <--usually a bad idea if you have a bad link.

#
USERS
Tells you who's logged on to the game, and where they are playing from.
Command also accepts a CLEAR argument which causes it to purge UNDEFINED.

#
"BALANCE"

    Balance is what keeps the mud under control. Without it, there would be
 unbelievably powerful items, and even more powerful mobiles in the game. 
 Currently we only monitor mobiles and objects. Rooms do not need monitoring
 because there is little within their fields that can be abused as far as 
 gameplay is concerned (however, do not look to add a 100 rooms zone filled   
 with 75 dt's) To see what current balance systems are in place, please see
 the following help files:

  OHELP BALANCE
  MHELP BALANCE

 If you have any questions or concerns about either system, please email 
 Nightwynde at nightwynde@crimson2.com, Bingo at bingo@crimson2.com, 
 Arachangel at archangel@crimson2.com, or Jyaaku at jyaaku@crimson2.com. 
#
LEVELS
    Lists the levels of your class. 

    Currently there are 50 levels.
 
    Levels 1 to 40 are mortal levels
    Level  41          avatar
    Level  42 +        Immortal levels

See also AVATAR IMMORTALS

#
BRIEF
Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of the
room you are in; only the name of the room, and the people and objects in
there. Unless you are very familiar with the area in which you travel, 
however, it is not advisable to use this command. Frequently, you will find 
small, but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

See also: COMPACT
#
!
Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

#
CONSIDER
Usage : consider <monster>
This command will compare several of your attributes against the char/mob
you are considering.  This command will show the actual calculations of
the player in the 'YOU' column, and an estimate of how powerful or weak
the considered mobile is in the 'OPPONENT' columns.  The fields of 
information in the command are as follows:

Level          :  Compares your level versus the mobile's level.
Hits           :  Compares your maximum hit points versus the opponents.
Magic          :  Compares your magical abilities against the opponents.
Damage Ablility:  Compares your ability to cause damage versus the opponents.

Example:
> con fido

By using this command, you agree not to hold Crimson responsible for any
losses real or perceived which result from your relying upon data provided.
Further, you agree to be happy with the additional data and won't grip or
complain about it.

#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.  After level 5,
you will advance one level at a time.   A level 1 to 3 char can gain
multiple levels with one kill.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

  * There are occasional rush periods which allow you to earn twice the
    experience for the same kills.

Some of us discourage killing of other players.  Some of us may take action.
The choice is yours.  Can you take a group of high levelers?

See Also: GROUP RUSH
#
RUSH
Rush is a special aspect of Crimson Mud that allows you to earn twice as
much experience for the same kills for a brief time.  There is a rush
period every 1.5 to 2 hours lasting from 1 until 10 minutes randomly.

See: EXPERIENCE
#
GROUP
Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP ALL

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equaly by level among the group. Experience points will only be 
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of the
killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>
      use <item> <optional target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful,
and yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

Other items can be used and only trial and error will reveal uses.

"OCOST_WEAPON"
  As always, we try yo keep things within balance. We don't want weapons costingtoo much, and others too little, so the following is a short guideline to 
follow:

damage:             500 coins per point
bits:
            slayer: 50000 coins per
         elemental: 7500/5000/2500 (fire/ice/elec)
        mana-drain: 40000 coins
          vampiric: 5000  coins
       silver/wood: 35000 coins each
         poisonous: 3000  coins
          blinding: 1500  coins
 good/evil/neutral: 30000 coins
           silence: 40000 coins

affects:
           damroll: 10000 coins/point
           hitroll: 7500  coins/point
             other: 5000  coins per adjustment

  You may, of course, vary the costs within reason. A golden sword, for example,may have the same stats as an iron sword in game terms, but will have a much 
greater value based upon its source metal.

#
"OCOST_ARMOR"
   As always, we try to keep things within balance. In an effort to prevent 
some items from costing too much, and others from costing too little, the 
following guide is provided:

affects:
               each damroll: 25000 coins
               each hitroll: 10000 coins
              each ac point: 500   coins
   each positive stat point: 100   coins
   each negative stat point: -50   coins

  You may, of course, vary as needed. A golden breastplate, for example, may 
have the same game stats as an iron breastplate, but in value be worth more 
based upon its source metal.

All eq is developed using a point system.  There is an ohelp file for each
body location detailing the points available for each level as well as
maximum damage, hitroll, and ac constraints.  Some of these values are
presented in decimal form but this is solely for continuity so please
always round down.

No deviation from this chart will be allowed without the permission
from the zoning council.

***** ZONE EQUIPMENT CONDITIONS ******
Players have two options when creating zones:

Option 1: Players may choose to create max items in their zones. All max items
          must first be approved by the zoning council, and even then there is
          a limit of 2 max items per zone. Each addition item after the maxes 
          must be calculated using the 80% tables in the OHELP <wear slot>
          files. 

NOTE: This is a 2-max-per-zone rule regardless of item minlevel.
 
Option 2: Players may choose to not create max items for their zones. In this
          case, they may create 5 items within the 100% points range for items,
          and then all other items will be calculated using the 90% point      
          tables provided in OHELP <wear slot>. This should help provide a 
          better balance for the zone, and thus still desirable to run.

In addition, no piece of eq will contain more than 1 max of either 
DAM/HITR/AC. For instance, you may not have 3dam and 50ac on legs. OR 3dam
3hitr. ETC. That goes with using combination of DAM with bonus_str or
AC with bonus_dex. Hence, no 2dam 1bonus_str 50ac or 3dam 40ac 1bonus_dex.
Only exceptions will be maxes of course.

Exceptions to this 2-max-items-per-zone rule may be made if petitioned
depending on all the following but not limiting to the following factors:
  1) Zone size      ( ## of unique mobs, rooms, objects, etc)
  2) Zone quality   ( desc, and creativity, difficulty, etc )
  3) Zoner activity ( zoning, balancing, contribution, etc )
  4) Overall zone   ( story, layout, theme, etc )

             adding a 3rd slayer (SEE NOTE2)                       =  80 value points

        Silence                                                    =  30 value points
        Mana_drain                                                 =  40 value points
        Silver/Wood_stake                                          =  30 value points
        Good/neutral/evil                                          =  30 value points

NOTE: The non-slayer flags above are the values if it is the only bit on 
      the weapon period. Should you deside to include more than one bit
      as mentioned above to a weapon SEE: OHELP OWEAPON_MULTI_BITS
NOTE1: Before making, consult a council member of your idea.
NOTE2: Basically, do not make any. SHOULD we ever consider it, this is how 
      much MIGHT cost.

        20 AC-oaffect        =  1 pt back (head, leg, body, or shield)

NOTE: AC-apply can not take negative values so you can't get pts back.
      Positive AC-oaffect IS detrimental ac.

Other restrictive flags:
        Anti_alignment                        =  5 pts back
        Anti_class                            =  3 pts back

        Lore 				      =  5 pts back

-Lore can only give points back on items that can be worn on multiple
 spots, like rings, or items you set in multiple wear slots such as body 
 and about body on.


No value has been placed on attributes and special abilities (invisibility,
strength, etc) for avatar eq so that there is still plenty of variety
among items but that does not mean that you can go over board! 
However, for mort eq SEE OHELP MORT_BALANCE or HELP OMORT_BALANCE.


*NOTE* costs are subject to change at any time, so please check the tables
       regularly to avoid any unnecessary changes later.

*ALSO NOTE* When setting size flags on an object, the first flag is worth -10
            points as it excludes 2 size classes, if 2 size flags are used it
            is only worth -5 points because only 1 size class is excluded. 3
            size flags of course would be worth 0 points because nothing is
            actually excluded.

*Please see OHELP MAXWEAPONDAM for a list of max dam values for weapons.

These are the mortal equipment point distribution.
The max balance points any mort item can have will remain the same and can 
be seen via OHELP <wear slot>.

No deviation from this chart will be allowed without the permission
from the zoning council. 

***** ZONE EQUIPMENT CONDITIONS ******
Players have two options when creating zones:

Option 1: Players may choose to create max items in their zones. All max items
          must first be approved by the zoning council, and even then there is
          a limit of 2 max items per zone. Each addition item after the maxes
          must be calculated using the 80% tables in the OHELP <wear slot>
          files.

NOTE: This is a 2-max-per-zone rule regardless of item minlevel.

Option 2: Players may choose to not create max items for their zones. In this
          case, they may create 5 items within the 100% points range for items,
          and then all other items will be calculated using the 90% point
          tables provided in OHELP <wear slot>. This should help provide a
          better balance for the zone, and thus still desirable to run.

In addition, no piece of eq will contain more than 1 max of either 
DAM/HITR/AC. For instance, you may not have 3dam and 50ac on legs. OR 3dam
3hitr. ETC. That goes with using combination of DAM with bonus_str or
AC with bonus_dex. Hence, no 2dam 1bonus_str 50ac or 3dam 40ac 1bonus_dex.
Only exceptions will be maxes of course.

Exceptions to this 2-max-items-per-zone rule may be made if petitioned
depending on all the following but not limiting to the following factors:
  1) Zone size      ( ## of unique mobs, rooms, objects, etc)
  2) Zone quality   ( desc, and creativity, difficulty, etc )
  3) Zoner activity ( zoning, balancing, contribution, etc )
  4) Overall zone   ( story, layout, theme, etc )

For beneficial affects points are distributed as follows:
      1 damage         = 20 value points      
      1 hitroll        = 15 value points
      BONUS_STR/DEX    = 35 value points (no more than 1, with some exceptions)
      BONUS_CHA        = 25 value points
      Extra_Attack     = n/a
      1 stat(hit,mana) =  1 value point
      2 stat(move)     =  1 value point
      attributes(all):
          levels 1-19  =  8 value points
         levels 20-40  =  5 value points
      container        = 10 value points
      Nosummon         =  5 value points 
      1 AC-apply       =  1 value point
      -1 AC-oaffect    =  1 value point (excludes head, leg, body, or shield)
      -2 AC-oaffect    =  1 value point (head, leg, body or shield)
      Breathwater      =  5 value points 
      Detection spells:
       sense/inv/darks =  4 value points
             good/evil =  2 value points
                 magic =  1 value points
      Regeneration: 
          level 1-19   =  8 value points
         level 20-40   =  5 value points
      Invis/Imp invis  =  5 value points

NOTE: Negative AC-oaffect IS beneficial ac.

Weapons are now split in points, check OHELP_WEAPON for more details.

In addition, to the normal armor values, the following aid for weapons is
available with points distributed as follows:
        Elemental bits(magic/darkmagic/flame/ice/acid/lightning) :
                         Level 1-19:          =  35/35/30/25/25/20 pts respectively
                        Level 20-40:          =  30/30/25/20/20/15 pts respectively
        Slayer bits(evil_slayer,etc.)         =  50 value points
        Poison                                =  15 value points
        Blinding                              =  10 value points
        Vampiric                              =  15 value points
        Silence                               =  40 value points
        Mana_drain                            =  20 value points
        Silver/Wood_stake                     =  40 value points
        Good/neutral/evil                     =  30 value points

NOTE: The non-slayer flags above are the values if it is the only bit on 
      the weapon period. Should you deside to include more than one bit
      as mentioned above to a weapon SEE: OHELP OWEAPON_MULTI_BITS

ALSO NOTE: NO dual slayers allowed for mortals.

For detrimental affects points are returned as follows:
        -1 damage            = 20 pts back   
        -1 hitroll           = 15 pts back
        -1 BONUS_STR/DEX     = 30 pts back
        -1 BONUS_CHA         =  0 pts back
        -1 stat (hit,mana)   =  1 pt back
        -2 stat(move)        =  1 pt back
        -1 attribute(all):
               levels 1-19   =  8 pt back
              levels 20-40   =  5 pt back
        -1 Extra_Attack      = n/a
        10 AC-oaffect        =  1 pt back (excludes head, leg, body, or shield)
        20 AC-oaffect        =  1 pt back (head, leg, body or shield)
        Haste                =  5 pts back

NOTE: AC-apply can not take negative values so you can't get pts back.
      Positive AC-oaffect IS detrimental ac.

Other restrictive flags:
        Anti_alignment                        =  5 pts back
        Anti_class                            =  3 pts back
        Anti_race                             =  2 pts back
        Anti_size (1flag)                     = 10 pts back
        Anti_size (2flags)                    =  5 pts back
        Lore 				      =  5 pts back

-Lore can only give points back on items that can be worn on multiple
 spots, like rings, or items you set say body and about body on.


*NOTE* costs are subject to change at any time, so please check the tables
       regularly to avoid any unnecessary changes later.

*ALSO NOTE* When setting size flags on an object, the first flag is worth -10
            points as it excludes 2 size classes, if 2 size flags are used it
            is only worth -5 points because only 1 size class is excluded. 3
            size flags of course would be worth 0 points because nothing is
            actually excluded.

*Please see OHELP MAXWEAPONDAM for a list of max dam values for weapons.

When calculating damge dice, use the following:

Multiply the first die by the second then multiply by two to get the points
used: example 4d5 = (4 * 5) * 2= 40, or 40 pts

*NOTE* Extra flag antis and such only give pts back for dice/wflags
       oaffect negatives and such only give pts back for oaffects

Otherwise, all point values are determined under the table in OHELP BALANCE.

SEE ALSO: OHELP MAXWEAPONDAM for maximum allowable damage per weapon group.

*NOTE* When making no_rent items, Dam, HR, and AC restrictions are ignored, but
points values are valid as per ohelp balance.

             the game will only cost 500 coins/day to rent. If you wish the
             object to rent for the full value of 50,000 coins, the orent needs

"MHELP_MATTACK" MATTACK
    Allows you to set multiple attacks for mobs.   The following
explantion provided by Cyric:

mattack <mob> <slot> <type> <skill second> <skill third> <skill forth>
  
  <mob> is the mobiles vnum.. that should be obvious
  
  <slot> is the slot number for the special attack between 1 and 4
     it works kind of like oaffects with mobs being able to have up to
     4 different style attacks(note the slot isnt the second/third 
     attack skill, a mob can have 4 attacks.. with each attack 
     consisting of multiple hits.. just hit Wraith Lord Moorgash for a
     good example;>)
  
  <type> is the type of hit the attack :-NONE, HIT, BLUDGEON, PIERCE,
     SLASH, WHIP, CLAW, BITE, STING, CRUSH..
  
  <skill second/third/forth> are the skills like the ones for pc's
     a value of between 0 and 99 for each of these gives the percent 
     chance of the hit.. given you successfully achieved the last extra
     hit.. you cant get a fourth attack if you didnt get the third attack.
     (see help pracs)

so an example for a mob that claws with a 50% chance of a second
attack.. then bites with no chance of a second attack.. then finaly
a slash with a 40% chance of a second.. then 50% of a third and 50%
of a fourth would be:
matt 1000 1 claw 50 0 0
matt 1000 2 bite 0 0 0
matt 1000 3 slash 40 50 50

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your healt in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.
#
HOUSES

Player Houses
-------------

It is possible for players on all experience levels to buy a house in the
residential area in the southern part of Midgaard.

As some areas are more sought after than others, the prices vary quite a bit
The base price of a house with one room and an ordinary lock is as follows:

	House on Emerald Avenue :  100,000,000 coins
	House on Elm Street     :   75,000,000 coins
	House on Park Road      :   50,000,000 coins

	The following objects can be purchased for an extra price:
	    Pick-proof lock     :   20,000,000 coins
            Private flag        :   20,000,000 coins
            Cant_Hunt flag      :   20,000,000 coins
            Link to the home of :   50,000,000 coins
              another (only by  :
              approval of both) :

	    Other suggestions will be taken into consideration.

Due to abuse of the privelege, storage of goods in houses for any period
of time will not be possible.  All houses will be fully equipeed with dump
flags though this MAY be reconsidered at a future date.

All houses will be a safe haven.  The killing of mobs or players within
houses will not be possible.  Nobody will be able to teleport into a
house.

When your house is created, you will be issued a key.  Should you lose
your key, you may buy another for 15 million coins.

Until the initial demand for the construction of houses dies down, you
must ask Shast personally to create your dream home.

#
MUZZLE
    There are a couple levels of muzzle.  If an immort believes your
language/statements to be inappropriate, the immortal can apply a 
muzzle flag to your character at the discretion of the immortal.  This
flag will prevent your char from speaking or performing any actions which
result in sound.  This flag must be removed by an immortal before you can
speak again.  Have a care, some immortals will muzzle for offenses so
slight as excessive spam while some may be less easily annoyed.

    There is also an AUTOMUZZLE flag that is automatically applied if
you use inappropriate language on gossip, shout, or auction channels.
The AUTOMUZZLE flag is automatically removed after 24 hours RL time. Use
the SCORE command to see how much time remains.  DO NOT ask an immort to
remove it!  If you got the flag, you can pay the penalty.   Keep in
mind also that the MUZZLEALL flag can be applied at anytime.

    IMMORTALS:  If you muzzle a player, please post on the immortal
                board that you did so, why you did it, and when it
                can be removed.  If a player ask you to remove a

JAIL
                                              
    Jail is one of the last line punishments you can get before more
serious and permanent action is taken.  You can do nothing while in jail
not even gossip, although you will see yourself gossip, it will not go to
the rest of the mud.  Your only form of communication is through the
appeals board.  On which you will see why you were jailed and for how
long.  You may plead your case there, however if it has come to you being
jailed, you probably won't get a change of mind.  Very few offenses bring
jail as your first warning, but for those offences the second warning is
usually deletion.
     This is the place of last resort before your character is deleted
from the database.  If jail doesn't get the message across...

LESSER_IMMORTALS

Arch-Avatar
    Arches main role in life are to exsist, socialize, earn a position in an
immortal group, learn about the administrative side of the mud, learn the
rules and help files, and help newbies.

Legend
    Legends have shown their stuff at one point or another but don't
actively help out any more.  They are a fount of information if you spot
one!  This is a position of honor.

Creator
    This variation of a Legend has at least one zone installed on the mud.

Methuselah
    Meths exsist to be the first line between mortals and the higher immortals
They should know the rules and know how to deal with problems and where to
look for answers.

Highlord
   Highlords may reimburse mortals if they feel the mortal lost his eq
for some reason outside of normal game play.  crashes, bugs, etc.
If the mortal lost his eq due to death or any other way from normal mud
play do NOT reimburse. Highlords also set new rules and enforce all rules,
new and old.

Overlord
   Overlords oversee the entire immstaff, and make sure everyone does their
job and is the one to take the flak from the imps if they aren't and take
the flak from the lower imms and morts when things go wrong. Overlords
are to be pitied almost as much as imps but not quite as much so as they
don't have to actually deal with the code.  An Overlord is the absolute 
highest any problem may go, once an Over rules on a situation it is done.

#
"EXTRA DAMAGE"
    Does extra damage once per mele round.  This is not per each attack.
    Amount is (damage / 4) or 25, which ever is lower.

DEATH:
   When you die, you lose experience, your equipment remains with your
   corpse at the location of your death.  Your gold remains with
   you.  You should quickly return to your corpse before it decays and
   you stuff is left lying around for anyone to pick up. 
       We do not allow player to take stuff from your corpse.  The 
   exception to this is when your killed by a mortal.  They are allowed
   to take one item from your corpse. This is only when a mortal kills a 
   pkiller.

See Also: PKILLER DEATHTRAP

#
DT DEATHTRAP
       These rooms kill you and subtract 200 from your kills/death score
and you will lost twice the experience lost during a normal death.
Avatars will also be affected by these rooms. Corpses can be collected
from the dressing room after re-entering the game.

NOTE: DeathTrapping can easily be avoided by looking where you walk
      for example if you type look west and west is a deathtrap you 
      should get a good indication of it. Avats shouldnt deathtrap at all
      since they seldomly walk, they always can mistype a room number
      thouh teleporting in deathtraps also happens lots. You should
      confirm you teleport from safe zones only like midgaard or temple of
      t'salhoic where no deathtraps are found. Teleporting to mobs which
      are in deathtraps is the risk a person who teleports has to take.

PKILLER "BULLY PKILLER"

      These flags are remnants of days gone by at Crimson II.  You will
      most likely only see these set on an immortal.      

See Also:  DEATH PKILLING

#
AFK

        This is a way to quickly tell others you are away from your 
    keyboard.  A message is printed letting everyone in the room know
    you are AFK.  You also have an <AFK> in your title on the who list.
    Enter AFK to turn it off.  Players in the room are notified that 
    you have returned.

#
WIPE
       The WIPE command will list all chars scheduled to be purged in 30
    days or less.   Because level 1 chars are purged after 7 days, and 
    would fill up the list, they are excluded from the list so its not
    cluttered.

        Old chars are purged if they haven't logged onto the mud for a
    specified period of time.

           Level 1 chars are purged if they haven't logged on in a week.
           Level 2 to 40 chars are purged after 4 months.
           Level 40+ chars are purged after 1 year.

        If you don't log on in two months, your equipment is purged.

        If you plan to be gone for more than 4 months, contact an IMP or
    above so your char can be saved.  We feel that 4 months is generous 
    and should cover the majority of circumstances.

    Crimson is based on DikuMUD code -- the Multi-User Dungeon developed
at DIKU (the Department of Computer Science at the University of 
Copenhagen).

VEHICLE
    Vehicles are available to transport you around the world.
Its possible some locations are only accessible via this means.
You can use the BOARD and EXIT commands when a vehicle is
loading/unloading passengers at a station.  You can't board/exit
a vehicle while its in motion.   A vehicle is always considered to
be in motion when its not at a station.

    Two things are required to set up a vehicle route.  The first
thing is to create a Vehicle object.   It must have type set to
VEHICLE and must not have a TAKE flag.   The objects cost is the
fare charged to board the vehicle.
    After creating the object, you need to set up the route it
follows.  There are 6 flags to assist with this.   
ROUTENORTH, ROUTESOUTH, ROUTEEAST, ROUTEWEST, ROUTEDOWN, and ROUTEUP
The vehicle will look for one of these flags and head in that 
direction.  A valid direction must exist when you set a route flag.
If one doesn't, the vehicle will stop in that room and be removed
from the list of valid vehicles.  You can set the link flags, 
NOCHAR and NOMOB to prevent players/mobiles from entering vehicle
routes.
    The system looks for extended object descriptions of ARRIVAL and
INTERIOR.  The ARRIVAL message is sent to chars in the room when a vehicle
arrives at a station.  The INTERIOR is used to set a vehicles interior 
description.

    The first ovalue can be used to set the chance a vehicle hits you. The
second ovalue will represent the % of your hits the damage will be. The
third ovalue is the minimum damage, The fourth ovalue the maximum damage.

RAGE
    Is the ability to go into a berserk mode of fighting.  Once in
rage, you cannot flee.  When you attack, each successful hit does
20% extra damage.

#
XYZZY
nothing happens.

#
NEWBIE_ABBREVIATE NEWBIE_ABBREVIATION
The mud has been coded so that you only have to type as little as is
possible to identify what you wish to to do.
What this means, is that instead of typing 'look', for example, you can
just type 'l'.
Gossip becomes gos, inventory becomes inv, etc etc.

The same applies with the names of items, mobs and other players.
eg, 'wear sword' can become 'wea swo', 'smile sunshine' can become
'sm sun', etc etc.

Also, all mobs in the game can be referred to as 'mob', and all items
can be referred to as 'obj', so 'give sword cityguard' could become
'giv obj mob'.

This code is fairly unusual, but once you have become used to it, it is
very useful and a fairly nice luxury.
#
NEWBIE_BANK
If you carry lots of money around with you all the time, it is at risk if
you are attacked by monsters.
Large amounts of money can be stored in the BANK, which can be found on the
map in this book (type 'look map').
To put money into the bank, type 'deposit <number of coins>'.
To take the money out again, type 'withdraw <number of coins>'.
to check how much you have stored, type 'balance'.

You can also store money at the receptionist in the same way, but she will
have a small charge for the service.

For further information, type 'help bank'.
#
NEWBIE_COMMUNICATE
You can communicate with the other users by a number of methods.
If you type 'who', you will be shown a list of the other players currently
in the game.
If you wish to speak directly to one of them, type
tell <player> <message>,  eg
tell conan  hi dude!.

If somebody tells to you, you can use 'reply' to reply to that person by
typing 'reply <message>', eg reply thank you for your help!  You can also
use reply if you can't see who it is telling to you.

If you type 'look' you will be able to see who else (if anyone) is in the
same room in the game as you.  If you type 'say <message>', everybody in the
room will get the message.

Next are the "global channels", this means that everybody in the game will
hear, if you talk on them.  They are used by typing '<channel> <message>'.
You can use the SHOUT, GOSSIP and AUCTION channels, although 'shout' should
be saved for an emergency.
eg, gossip Hello World!
and everybody else would see
Gossip: [Conan] Hello World!

With all of these you should remember people play here for fun, and you
should not be abusive or offensive to others when talking on these channels.

Type 'help gossip', and ALL of the channels will be explained, although you
will not be able to see all of them until you have progressed further into
the game.
#
NEWBIE_DONATE NEWBIE_DONATION
The donation room is where generous players who find they have gathered more
equipment than they need can leave it for other players to find.
It is a very good place to check if you are very low level in the game.

Note, since this equipment is donated, you should not try to get all of it
unless you are actually going to use it.

When you have progressed a little, you may wish to donate items yourself
to help other new players.  This is done by typing 'donate <item name>'.

See 'help donate'.
#
NEWBIE_EQ
As you explore the game, you will accumulate more and more items of
equipment, some will be usefull and others will not.
To see a list of what you are carrying but are not actually USING, type
'inv'  (short for inventory).

To see a list of the items you are using, type 'eq' (short for equipement).
These items will be shown against where on your body there are being worn.
Most items will only fit a certain location, example boots will only fit on
your feet, and you need to try to find the best items for each place.

To pick up an item from the ground, type 'get <name of object>'.
To drop an item again, type 'drop <name of object>'.

To wear an item, type 'wear <name of object>',
and to stop using it again, type 'remove <name of object>'.

You have wield weapons.  For example, 
     WIELD SWORD

When you look at another player, by typing "look <name of player>', you 
will see a list of the items they are wearing.  If you are a thief you
may be able to see what they are carrying in their inventory (and possibly
try to steal it) but other classes cannot see this.

Further help can be found by typing help <keyword> :
EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY, WEAR, REMOVE
#
FIGHTING NEWBIE_FIGHTING
When you meet a monster, you can get a rough idea of how tough it would be
to fight against by typing 'con <monster name>' (short for consider).
Note this is only a rough guide though.
If you decide to fight it, you should type 'kill <monster name>' to
attack it, and you will then begin the fight.
If you are a magic user, you may be able to cast spells also... check the
SPELLS page for this.
If you kill the monster, you will score 'experience points', which will
help you toward gaining your next level, the process which makes you 
stronger.
During the fight, you will be able to check on how healthy your opponent is
by typing 'diag <monster name>'.
If he seems to be very healthy and you are not, he may be too tough for you.
If this is the case, you can run by typing 'flee'.
 
See help on : KILL, DIAG, FLEE.
#
NEWBIE_HELP
The mud has a fairly detailed database of help files to explain how
everything works.  To use, you can type 'help' on it's own for a list of
some keywords, or you can type 'help <keyword>' to see details about that
certain keyword.
eg, help wear

#
WEAR NEWBIE_WEAR
If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.
For example : wear boots
wear all will equip all your eq and chose a weapon.

NEWBIE_MOVING
First off, you should notice on the right-hand end of your prompt, there 
is something like 'ex[D U]'.
This is a list of the possible exits from the room you are in. N E S W U and
D, refer to north, east, south, west, up and down.
You can move in the directions shown by typing the first letter of the word.
If the letter in the 'ex[  ]' box is lower case, it means there is a door
in the way.
Doors can be opened and closed using the 'open <door name>' and
'close <door name>' commands.
 
See help on : NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, OPEN, CLOSE.
#
NEWBIE_PRACS

AS you progress through the game, you will wish to aquire new powers and
abilities, to make yourself more powerful.
Magic users, such as mages and clerics get mostly magic spells, whilst
fighters and theives get no magic, only skills.
Other classes such as paladin, are somewhere in between.

Each class has an appropriate "guildmaster", who can teach you new powers.
First you must find your guildmaster.  You can do this by typing
look map, to see the map in this book, and looking for which of the four
guilds is for your class.
When you reach your guild, type 'prac' for a list of things you can learn.
Typing 'prac <ability name>' will actually learn it a little better.
You have a limited number of PRACTICES.  These are used to learn things, and
you will gain more of them when you gain levels.

If you type 'prac' when you are away from your guildmaster, you will be
given a list of everything you have learned.
You can choose from these things when you want to use a spell or skill.

For further information, type 'help practice'.
#
NEWBIE_RENT 
You don't have to rent from Crimson Mud.  Simply type quit and you will
re-enter the game where you left off!
#
NEWBIE_RESTING
After a fight or whilst travelling long distances you may find yourself
worn down.  You can correct this by sleeping or resting until you are
strong again.
The commands are 'sleep' to sleep, and 'wake' when you have finished,
OR 'rest' to rest, and 'stand' when you are finished.
Sleeping will heal you fastest, but you cannot see what it going on around
you at the same time.

If you go three north from the Midgaard Fountain, to the "By the Altar"
room.   At this room, enter PRAY and it will restore all your lost hit
points and heal blindness/poison.   It will also removed curses and 
cursed items.  The healing part ends after you reach level 10.

#
NEWBIE_SHOPS
On the main street in midgaard, and in many of the other towns you will
find in the game, there are shops.

When you enter a shop, you can view a list of what is for sale by
typing 'list'.	
Once you have decided what you want, typing 'buy <item name>' will buy
it, assuming you have enough money (gold coins).
If you want to sell something, you can type 'value <item name>' to check
how much you will be given for the item, and if you like the price you
can type 'sell <item name>' to sell it.

The midgaard shops can be seen on the map in this book.

Further information can be found by typing 'help <keyword>' :
SHOPS, BUY, SELL, LIST, VALUE
#
NEWBIE_SPELLS
The general way spells are cast is to type
'cast <spellname> <target>', although some spells do not need a 'target', 
and you just type 'cast <spellname>'.

All of the spells and skills have specific help files, and these should be
read for more detail.

#
NEWBIE_STATS
How good your character is, is defined by your STATS and ATTRIBUTES.
Your STATS can be seen on your prompt, something like
[H20 M85 V80].
The H is hitpoints, or how much damage you can take before you are killed.
If it reaches zero you are dead.
The M is mana.  This is the power you use to cast spells.  If it gets too
low, you may not have enough left to cast all of the spells you wish.
The V is your movement points, and they go down as you walk around.
As well as on your prompt, these can also be seen when you type "score".
When you type score, the number in brackets is what your stats will be when
they are at full strength.
All three of these will return to normal when you "rest" or "sleep" for a
while.

Your ATTRIBUTES do not change whilst you are playing.  These are:
INTelligence, STRength, WISdom, CONstitution, CHArisma and DEXterity.
These determine a number of subtle things about how your character will
grow as you play, but for now we do not need to worry too much about them.

Further help can be found by typing help <keyword> :
HITPOINTS, MANA, MOVEMENT, INT, WIS, STR, CON, DEX, CHA.
#
NEWBIE_SUSTENANCE.
You will be immune to it's effects for a short time as a newbie, however
sooner or later you will find yourself hungry and/or thirsty.  
To quench a thirst, you must find water.  There are a number of water
containers in the game, and an endless supply of water at the fountain
(see the map in this book).
Food can be bought from a store, of found in some areas of the game.
To drink, you type 'drink <container name>', and to eat you type
'eat <food name>'.
You can see HOW hungry/thirsty you are by typing ATT.
 
#
NEWBIE_WALKING
    Its how you get around.  You have movement points and each time you
walk somewhere, those points go down.  When they reach zero, you can't
move until you get points back.  As time passes, used up points are
restored.

    You can move around by typing the commands: n,s,e,w,u, or d to
go north, south, east, west, up, or down respectively.

    This section of your prompt will tell you which ways you can go:
ex[N U].  If the letter is in lower case, it means there is a closed
door in the way.  NOTE:  enter DISPLAY EXIT to turn the exit prompt
on and off.

The AUTOMUZZLE flag is automatically removed after 24 hours RL time. Use
the SCORE command to see how much time remains.  DO NOT ask an immort to
remove it!  If you got the flag, you can pay the penalty.   Keep in
mind also that the MUZZLEALL flag can be applied at anytime.

The Currrent list of automuzzle words are:
shit, fuck, ass, whore, cunt, hail, and muzzle_me_please

An attempt to avoid being automuzzled will usually result in a godmuzzle
so it's advisable to either take the automuzzle, or find a better word
to use.

Also, exsessive use on the avatar and immortal channel may also result
in a god muzzle.  So please use some common sense.

PASSWORDS HACKING

We will not take responsibility for characters that are hacked, or abused 
due to somone else knowing the password or sharing the character.
If your character is hacked or otherwise accessed by another person and
terrible things are done where an imm has to deal with the person that may
end in muzzling, jailiing or deleting, then we are sorry, but you will not
be compensated for those actions.

As with *all* your passwords, they should be impossible to guess, a three
letter password isn't security, it's foolish. If you think someone knows
your password, change it. We recommend changing your password once a month
or so to keep your character absolutely secure.

Any site found to be hacking characters will be banned totally and 
probably permanently, and the system administrators will be contacted.
We have a *0* tolerance level for hackers and will not put up with it.

BOARDS
There are two boards for reading in the town of Midgaard.  One is the general
Mud Board (also known as the mortal board) which can be found in the Reading
Room, 2 north and 1 west from Market Square (or 1 down 1 west 1 north 1 west
from the Reception) (See: MAP)This board is the second place to look for 
news (See: NEWS) about the mud,any new rules, and to leave your imput about 
how things are going and to post any ideas.

The second board is the Social board which is in the Common Square which is
1 south from Market Square (See: MAP) This board is where you will find notes
from other players saying hi, requesting help, hiring out their services, 
advertising their clans, and information about any current quests or hellnights.

To write or post on a board you should first use "look board" to see what 
messages are on there.  To read them use "read <##>" where ## is the number
you want to read.   This is an example of what you will see:

This is a bulletin board.  Usage: READ/REMOVE <messg #>, WRITE <header>.
You will need to look at the board to save your message.
There are 20 messages on the board.
1  : Sun Apr 20 (Kinetic)    :: Contest
2  : Wed May  7 (Kinetic)    :: re:Silly clans
3  : Thu May  8 (Jupiter)    :: *nod Kinetic*
4  : Fri May  9 (Silthanus)  :: Quest *Great Prizes* Avats only plz
5  : Fri May  9 (Pippin)     :: re:Quest
6  : Fri May  9 (Slaughter)  :: re:Quest
7  : Fri May  9 (Kinetic)    :: HELLNIGHT SCORES!!!
8  : Fri May  9 (Kinetic)    :: HELLNIGHT CONTINUED!!!
9  : Fri May  9 (Raver)      :: avat eq sell
10 : Fri May  9 (Parry)      :: re:Quest

If you wanted to read about the current quest you would use "read 4" for
example.

If you wanted to post a message you would use "write <title>" where title is
what you would want people to see when they look at the board.
After you type that you will be put in an editor to write your post and
will end it with a line with nothing but a "@" on it, for Example:

write example
Write your message.  Terminate with a @.


] this is just an example on how to post on the boards
] had this been an actual post it would consist of something 
] meaningful
] -kinetic
]@

To save your post to be sure it will still be there after a reboot or crash
you must look at the board again:

21 : Sun May 11 (Kinetic)    :: example

If you decide you don't want your post on there you can always remove it
with "remove <##>" where ## is the number of your post:

remove 21
Message 21 Sun May 11 (Kinetic)    :: example removed.

   - Note: you can only remove your own posts, other posts can only be 
     removed by higher immortals.

ZSTUFF

DO NOT CREATE MAX KIT ITEMS IN YOUR ZONES
-sorry but everyone trys to outdo the other it has to stop
-we have enough max kit items as is, until further notice.

Do not discuss your zone with anyone other than immortals, ANYONE.
Do NOT go into other zones, work in only yours.
Do NOT stat objects or mobs from new zones period, or old unless
given permission by a OVER+.

very important: SAVE YOUR ROOMS BEFORE YOUR RCOPY
very important: SAVE YOUR OBJECTS AND MOBS FIRST! DONT LOAD THEM TIL YOU DO!
very important: USE ZEDIT SHOW before creating zcmds
mhelp balance gives the table for balancing mobs, use this
-mhelp exp, mhelp hp, mhelp dam, mhelp ac, mhelp gold for a small quick reference
ohelp balance gives the table for balancing objs, use this
ohelp <wear pos> gives you the points you may allocate to objs.
-you dont need to use them all, thats the max points an obj can
-have, otherwise if you go over you need to clear that with Bingo.

When making mobs make sure to use the mhelp balance chart.
-Type news for alot more details on that.
Make sure if you give a mob sanctuary you cut the balance
hitpoints in half.
When using balance things for mobs you may use any range
that is between the previous level and the level after the
one your balancing, within reason... not just 1 above or below.
Do not put the spell elsewhere on your mobs.

Forgetting commands type:
mhelp
ohelp
rhelp
zhelp
-for help on commands within those just use help <command>

if you need to know what certain flags mean you can use:
help mflags1 mflags2 etc
or
help oflags1 oflags2 etc
I must emphasis USE HELPFILES, READ ALL THE STUFF ON ZONING
it can be a mess and pain if you dont.

And always, if you really need help and cant figure out ask
a HIGH+ they will most likely be able to help you.

QUEST_EMAX

Here is the CURRENT list of what is considered max for each level basse.
(this could change at any time, so always check up before loading things)
Max eq is NOT to be loaded in any quest.

Under no circumstance should any of this information of what is max be
given out or told to other players.  If you already knew it was max, as
your mortal you can say as such, but as your imm you cannot.  If you didn't
know, then it is immortal only information and should stay as such.

Lists are in the following individual helpfiles as it was too spacy for
one: QUEST_EMAX_41, QUEST_EMAX_30, QUEST_EMAX_20, QUEST_EMAX_10

Second, no form scrolls can be given out.  Simple reason: ANTES and HIGHS
cannot cast forms.  Questmaster doesn't sell forms, so qps swap for scrolls
would be useless.

Third, NO_RENT eq is encouraged over regular eq, cause in most cases it is
better, or much better than anything that can be found, which compensates
for the lack of it being permanent.  Some NO_RENT eq is EXTREMELY good and
should have approval for use.  A list will be compiled of NON_APPROVAL 
NO_RENT eq and will be located in the helpfile QUEST_NO_RENT.

Fourth, equipment that has fewer than 5 copies in the game cannot be used.
We do not want to compete with natural pop ratios.  Eq used in quests are
to SUBSIDIZE, not outshine, natural eq popping.

Fifth, do not use any eq with less than 3% pop rate.  Even if it isn't max
or second max.  This eq is meant to be intentionally rare.  3% or higher
pop ratio, please.

UPDATES

02/16/02
Updated code for new Imm structure
Set levels of imms/zoners appropriately

Added oclass command - Usage: oclass <vnum> <anti_class>
*Only works on ITEM_ARMOR atm

Some of you may or may not know about the RACE_ONLY/ANTI_RACE
added to ITEM_ARMOR, I plan on making a command for it, but for
now its only settable via ovalues.
Its ovalue <vnum> <ac> <race values> <this is for anti class ignore it>
in the race values you use the race number if you want the item to be
ANTI_<that race>, you add 50 to the race number if you want it to be
<that race>_ONLY.
example: putting 1 in race values would make it ANTI_HUMAN
         putting 1+50, 51 in the race values slot would make it HUMAN_ONLY
Sorry but due to limitations, it is only possible to put 1 ANTI_RACE on an
item at a time.

Both class/race additions to armor have some display problems on ident and
such, still working on that, but they work fine.

Some zoners will notice a new wiztitle, as well as not being
able to leave their zone, that was intended so noone will be
tempted to venture out of their zone.

03/17/02

Added 2 new otypes QUEST and QUEST_WEAPON.
These are to be used only for quest items, would like to convert all current
over to these as well.  These flags add a timer system to the objects so they
decay over time.  No longer will we need to make quest items NO_RENT.
Basically QUEST works like ARMOR except it doens't have the anti class/race
ovalues yet, I might use those for something else down the line.
QUEST_WEAPON is exactly like a WEAPON.
When these items are loaded their timers are auto set to 144 (3 hours real time).
The timers tick down 2 if worn, so essentially this would be 1 1/2 hours real time
roughly, but it'll flux depending on if worn or not, if it isnt it only ticks down 1.
These timers can only be set via oset after loaded, but since they are for quests it
leaves almost limitless possibilties on time at time of creaton.

03/21/02

Added ITEM_QSTLIGHT type, works like a light.

04/13/02

Added ITEM_QSTCONT type, works similar to reg containers, but only ovalue 1 does
anything.

Also restricted the at command for spirits to their zone only.

I'll try to keep this updated with any additions to this port. - Bingo
