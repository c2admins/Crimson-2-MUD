	&w*&n Version 172 of the source code is now running.  Now avatars always have
	  a cool-down period on potion quaffs.  Additional changes are: minor 
	  typo fix, Xanth should be less crash-prone, changes from our coding 
	  repository when we changed to Bazaar, and now there's a reminder to 
	  vote for our MUD on the MUDCONNECTOR site thanks to Bane / Archangel 
	  on production port.

	&w*&n We ought to maybe keep track of news events over on this port as well, 
	  so here it goes.
	&w*&n For a general (and still somewhat incomplete) tutorial on how to be a 
	  zonelord and use the Builder bit commands, visit the zoning wiki pages
	  on &uc2trac.frankfleschner.com&n for some guidance.  As always, you can 
	  rely upon other zonelords or the GrindMaster Zonelord himself, Sprocket.
	&w*&n Existing zones are in the process of being updated / upgraded.  As you 
	  become proficient with your zoning abilities, you may be requested to 
	  help with the work.  This will be a real and fairly immediate 
	  opportunity to flex your zoning nuts and show your contribution to the 
	  betterment of the game.

Sat May 11 - Added some new helpfiles for balance. These new tables and rules 
             will be retroactive for all zones that were either modified or new
             within the past 2 years. If you do not wish to abide by these rules
             you may put in a zone removal request, but keep in mind all eq from
             the removed zone will be taken from the production port with no
             reimbursements.                                           

Thu Sep 06 - New helpfiles added: 90% tables for balance on all OHELP <wearslot>
             and a secondray option for creating zones under ohelp_avat_balance2
             and ohelp_mortal_balance2.
