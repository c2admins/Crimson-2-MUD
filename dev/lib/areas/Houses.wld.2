Onslaught's House~
Onslaught is a moron.  His house is a rusty little shack that smells
like pee.  It looks like homeless people have written Onslaught's
mom's phone number on the wall with unflattering remarks next to it.

Chobbie's House~
Welcome to Chobbie's home. You see beaded curtains and peace signs galore.
A variety of water bongs and similar paraphanalia line a high shelf.
You notice smoke and a funny odor wafting out of the back room.
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the atmosphere. :)
