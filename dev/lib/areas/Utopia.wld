&WThe sacred, secret entrance to &yU&Yt&yo&Yp&yi&Ya~
It appears you have, through dumb luck, managed to stumble into Utopia.
You have only heard tales of this magical land.  You have also heard that
there is an amazing battle going on here.  Millenia ago, Traichek and his
clan of undead barbarians decided to invade the most fertile piece of real
estate in the whole MUD!  This room is dusty and the tunnel only leads one way, south.
There are torches on the wall.  You approach to take one but it vanishes from your sight.

&kThe Gargoyle's &rB&Rl&ro&Ro&rd&Ry &BH&ba&Bv&be&Bn~
You enter a room and you observe a pedestal - blocking the gate.  The gate has a huge
key hole in it and the hole glows with a magical aura...something appears to be oozing
out of it.  You realize after a quick look that it is bile.  Your attention turns
to the pedestal and the figurine sitting on top of it.  All the sudden of mental
images enter your head.  You see Blood, Death, and Pestilence.  You see pain
and beauty.  The figurine is a gargoyle and you approach it.  To your
astonishment, it moves, blocking the gate.  Looks like you have your work cut
out for you.

Damn that gargoyle was tough wasn't it?  As you enter &yU&Yt&yo&Yp&yi&Ya &Byou see miles
of &gg&Gr&ga&Gs&gs &Bin all directions.  It looks lovely and reaches about waist high.
As you reach to touch it it shrinks away and suddenly starts to &ywilt...&B
You can sense the evil of Traichek and his minions and so does the &yland.  &BYou
see nothing around as far as they eye can see.  You turn around to look at the gate but it has
mysteriously disappeared.  The &gg&Gr&ga&Gs&gs &Bis all you see.

The second golden dome.  It is a circular a room with a throne in the middle.
There are numerous statues around the circumfrence.  This is Jolio's
throne room.  He sits atop of it looking bored.  The whole room is made out of
diamonds, including the statues and the throne itself.  It sparkles
so much that you are about to rip your eyes out.

You are astonished at the sight before your eyes.  There are several golden domes
before your eyes.  There is a small door that leaves into the first dome.  You can't see
anything past them.  There is a plaque hanging on the first door.

This is the first golden dome, Rina's tomb.  You see her lying
down on a marvelous pyre constructed out of ebony.  The room
is dimly lit by a singular candle in the middle of the room.
The walls are made out of red brick and it's extremely warm
in here.  Rina doesn't seem to mind too much.

You have entered the third golden dome.  It's a large room with sand
on the floor.  You see Mercutio in the middle, smiling as he conjures monsters
out of think air and kills them.  The sand is stained with blood and corpses
are piling up.  There is no furniture in this room.  There is a niche in the
wall where Mercutio must sleep when he is tired of being undead.  Mercutio
kills yet another critter and the blood sprays all over you.

gravity here.  You see a meditating man floating with his legs in the
lotus position.  He is smoking a pipe and some sweet scents are
coming out of it.  You start to experience synasthaesia.  The room
is bare except for a cushion on the floor that strangely enough is
not floating.  You just want to make it to the next room and get the
hell out of here.

The fifth dome's entrance is a small, dark hallway that twists everywhere.
The room is a maze and you have to get on your knees and crawl around
in the pitch black to find your way.  You finally get into an opening
where Mandar is.  There are candles shining light onto his face.
He looks kind, although weary.  You don't understand how such a good
person could get stuck in such a dark room.

torturing Kazan, the mightiest guardian.  The room is an oval and there were once lush
gardens in it, but not it is just dead and brown.  Kazan is lying on a bed of hot coals
and is tied up.  Traichek and Tybalt have their backs turned to you and apparently don't notice
enter the room.  Kazan does and gives you a pitiful look.

This is the gate to the Red City, the principal habitat of the residents

with only a few brave souls continuing the fight.  Legend speaks of
the great heroes who have died defending their once proud homeland.

hottest nightspot in town, with such celebrities as Henark
and Boris frequently dropping in.  Today is is just another
empty building.

Damn that gargoyle was tough wasn't it?  As you enter &yU&Yt&yo&Yp&yi&Ya &Byou see miles
of &gg&Gr&ga&Gs&gs &Bin all directions.  It looks lovely and reaches about waist high.
As you reach to touch it it shrinks away and suddenly starts to &ywilt...&B
You can sense the evil of Traichek and his minions and so does the &yland.  &BYou
see nothing around as far as they eye can see.  You turn around to look at the gate but it has
mysteriously disappeared.  The &gg&Gr&ga&Gs&gs &Bis all you see.

You stand before the Red City, the former home of the mortal citizens of Utopia.
Unfortunately most of them left when the undead scourge came but a few brave
