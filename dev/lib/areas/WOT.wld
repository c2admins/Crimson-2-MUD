Darthy's Swank Lil' Pad~
You snicker softly at the ridiculousness of this room.  The mismatched patterns
and colors remind you of somet cheezy porno set.  As you step into the room 
your feet are lost in the thick, multi-colored shag carpet.  Lounging on the
pink, overstuffed sofa you see some scantilly clad tricks that happen to be 
Darth's flavor of the month.  One blonde, one brunette, and ALL women.  In the
corner you notice some stoner in the bean bag chair but you don't give him
another thought.  Let the brotha enjoy his high you think to yourself.
You finally settle into a comfortable armchair and lose yourself in the myriad
of lights scattered across the walls from the disco ball overhead.  If you had
to describe this joint in one word it'd be pimpin'!

Cobblestone Bridge~
As you step onto the bridge you get the feeling that, while it looks run-down
and old, it's actually quite secure.  The thick stone slabs are hard beneath
your feet and even the cheerful sound of distant birds cannot lighten your
spirits.  Hopefully this quaint little village will have a place to rest.

Winespring Way~
The street you are on is the main thoroughfare for the town fondly referred to
as Edmond's Field by the locals.  The surrounding area is rich in color from
the various wildflowers and other vegetation indigenous to this area.  You can
hear children laughing in the distance, but yet something doesn't feel right
here.  Houses along the road appear boarded up and the few older folk you see
appear guarded and uneasy.

The street you are on is the main thoroughfare for the town fondly referred to
as Edmond's Field by the locals.  This road runs north/south through the
village.  To the east you can see a wide open field, bare except for a lone
flag pole jutting out of the ground.  This area looks well used and is
possibly a place for festivities during better times.

Winespring Way~
For all intents and purposes, this is the center of the village.  The majority
of traffic fills this part of the street as the few villagers outdoors go 
about their business.  Most bustle about with a quick step and a downcast eye.
What is wrong with these people?  To the west you see the Winespring Inn.
Seems as good a place as any to rest your feet and trest yourself to a cold
beverage.

Winespring Inn~
Well, this is a cozy place.  The room is surprisingly warm, despite the hardwood
floor.  There is a roaring fire along one side of the room and a bookshelf
containing approximately 10-15 novels of various lengths on another.  A small
calico cat is curled up on the mantle and appears to be dozing.  You see an
empty chair against the window overlooking the village green and suddenly feel
drawn to it.  Boy are your feet tired!

This farm house is in immaculate condition.  Hung upon one wall is a beautiful
piece of needlework, sewn from intriate stitches and many different colors.
Such a piece must have demanded a steady hand and a steady patience.  Next to
the door you see several pairs of shoes, modest in design, and an overcoat.  It
appears someone is home.

This is the common area in the Aybara farm house.  At night, it's a place to
gather around a warm fire and tell tales of honor and romance.  To laugh and
cry, and to share the joys of being a family.  At this hour, however, the room
is empty.  The men are probably still out working in the fields you gather.

takes up most of the room and as you get closer you notice intricately carved
designs around the legs of the table and chairs.  Whoever built this furniture
must be a master carpenter.  Along one wall you see a painted portrait of what
you figure must be the Aybara's themself.  A large family, you wonder why the
house is so empty.

feel sympathy for such a large man to have to live in such a confined area.  The
small twin bed along one wall looks worn and in need of repair.  It also looks
recently slept in.  The only other piece of furniture you see is a foot chest
at the end of the bed.

red hot sparks into the air.  Upon further study you notice a piece of metal
sticking out of the flames.  It looks like Master Luhhan must have left in a

oak desk, and a fairly ornate wooden and leather footlocker.  It seems
that Mat is not terribly concerned with shape of the rest of the house, 
so long as those Trollocs stay out of his room.  Even if Mat is not 
here there are enough signs to prove whose room it is.  There is a 
dice cup near the bed, a large weapon that seems to be a hybrid of a 
staff and a spear, and off in the corner you catch the light gleaming 
off a dagger with a ruby encrusted on the hilt.

The Dark Woods~
You have wandered into the old forest south of town.  It looks like there was
once a path here leading further south, but the grass and brush has overgrown
much of the path and it's hard to see.  Doesn't look like this road must get
much use now that the Trollocs keep most people indoors.
