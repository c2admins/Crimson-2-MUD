mob vorn ul'azzr drow god~
&KVorn Ul'Azzr&W, the &cRenegade &wGuardian&n~
&KVorn Ul'Azzr&w stands here, guarding his lands from &revil&w.&n
~
     Here stands before you a proud and noble drow. At a young age he was sent to the surface 
world by his father when his house was attacked by a rival. After many cold sleepless nights in a
strange new world, a kindly druid happened upon the young drow and took him in as his own child. 
It was through this druid that Vorn learned the ways of the ranger, and when the old human passed
from this life, the drow remained steadfast in his ways of the forest. Shortly after Vorn found
himself alone in the world, he happened upon the aftermath of a great battle that was held in his
forest domain. Corpses lay littered everywhere, but the young drows curiousity overtook him, and 
he found himself walkign through the battlefield searching for treasures and signs of life. While
examining the corpse of a robed figure, he found a book with strange magical runes. Being an elf,
he had a particular affinity for magic, and though he couldn't fully understand the writings 
inside, he decided to pack the book away for further study...an smart decision considering he
later became one of the most powerful mortal mages in the realm..but that is another story. As 
Vorn was ready to leave the battlefield, he saw a movement out the the corner of his eye. There, 
hidden by some bushes was a small childlike creature. At first he was not sure what to make of
the little girl. She was covered in blood from head to toe, but her fur covered body and pointed
ears proved she was no human. He decided to help the poor child, and though she was frightened, 
she was also hungry, and the drow had a warm and gentle smile so she eventually accepted being 
led off. After washing her at a nearby stream, it became abundantly clear that the small child 
was a feline. Though felines had superior survival skills, she was still too young to have 
learned very much, so he decided to adopt her and call her Kayala. To this day it is not known
to many what ever happened of this feline child, but many rumours abound of a savage cat-lady

her mate to the death if provoked.

mob magick bloodstone ~
&BM&ca&wgi&cc&Bk &RB&rloo&Rd&Kstone&n~
&BM&ca&wgi&cc&Bk &RB&rloo&Rd&Kstone&w stands here, gazing out the window to the &Gg&garden&Gs &wbelow.&n
~
   Magick Bloodstone, High Lady of Brimstone, High Councilmember - First Chair, and public icon.
Early in her career Magick was an arrogant, quick tempered pure bred elf who thought she knew it
all, and was always right. Her time spent with the Circle of Fate has since tamed her fiery 
attitude and humbled her to the point that, once Brimstone was built shemade an excellent leader in
Vorn's absence. When the council is not in session, she can often be seen in the gardens, or within
her chambers staring out the window as is the weight of the entire city were on her shoulders.
  Though over two hundred years old, Lady Magick looks little more than a young woman in her 
late teens. Her long brown hair is often tied with a blue ribbon into a ponytail which falls to
the middle of her back. Her eyes are a deep hazel, very uncommon in elves, and at times seem to
change color with her mood. She often wears simple robes or dresses, not feeling the need to 
dress in the noble fashion that she once did. She treats those around her with respect and 
compassion and asks simply that she be treated the same...the marks of a good leader.

&WSy&wll&Wva &RB&rloo&Rd&Kstone&n~
&WSy&wll&Wva &RB&rloo&Rd&Kstone &yis here, training her troops.&n
~
  Syllva is the twin sister of Magick and is identical to her in every respect save for her long, 
flowing silver hair that she lets hang loose around her shoulders. After retiring from adventuring
she took over the duty of training the city guard, as well as the dragonriders that safeguard the
skies over Brimstone. She has been labeled as a ruthless warrior in times of battle, but a patient
and wise instructor.
  She stands just over five feet tall, the typical height for a female elf. her long, pointed ears
are adorned with several fashinable earrings, and she still wears the suit of full platemail that
she did in her years as an adventurer. She wields a wicked looking spear dubbed Twisted Moonlight
that never leaves her side. Though she looks no older than a teenager, her hazel eyes hold the 
wisdom of her two hundred year existance on this world, as well as a deep, dark secret she is 
afraid to tell.

Syllva the Weredragon~
&yA large &wDragonlike&y creature is here scowling at you.&n
~
  Replacing the form that was once Sylvanya, this twisted half-elf, half dragon creature is a 
terrifying force of destruction. Vaguely humanoid in appearance, she walks upright on two legs, and
at a distance could be mistaken for a lizardman. Small silver scales cover her entire body, save 
for the large leathrey wings which she now uses to fly. Her razor sharped maw twists into a wicked
grin as she inhales to let loose her special attack....the air has grown cold and their is a hint
of frost in the air.

&rSinge&n~
&rSinge, ruler of the pseudodragons, lays here passing the time.&n
~
  Singe, like all pseudragons appears to be a miniature form of its larger dragon cousin in every
way including his dreaded breath attack. Of course because the dragon is so small the attack 
would be little more than a nuisance, but you now stand only six inches tall and the pseudodragons
are full sized dragons. Singe's body is covered in deep red scales that glisten in what little
light fills the chamber. The membranes of his wings and underbelly are black, exposing him for the
royalty he is among pseudragons. His emerald eyes are full of life, but look sad, as if he has 
suffered some great loss recently in his life.

&yA gargantuan &wstone statue &ystands here guarding the gates.&n
~
  Standing roughly fifteen feet tall, the golem has been formed from tough granite stone and had
life breathed into it by a powerful mage or cleric. It is a mindless automaton that can do little
more than a simple task such as guarding a specific treasure or other object like a gate. Though 
not intelligent, they make fearsome fighters, and their tough stone shell has been known to be 
impervious to all but magical weapons.

mob shorn phantomspell~
&rShorn Phantomspell&n~
&rShorn Phantomspell&y stands here, patiently waiting for complaints.&n
~
  A short, rather plump looking gnome, Shorn was an illusionist by trade that happened across the Circle of
Fate, and by circumstances was taken into their ranks. For a gnome he is very vivacious, striking up conver-
sations with all who cross his path, and loving to perform little tricks to amuse the crowds that gather 
within the courtyard. When Brimstone was founded and the adventurers decided to retire, Shorn undertook the 
role of handling city complaints. His exceptional charisma and people handling skills have given him a great
rapport with the people of the city, and it is partially because of him that the council is favored so heavily
in this city. Shorn is often found just within the open doors of the castle, standing upon a small podium so
that he is not overlooked by the 'taller' folk. If you have a complaint, any complaint, bring it to Shorn. He
will make sure that your voice is heard.

mob T'alsril Lekess lizardman warrior~
&GLekessek Ril&n~
&GLekessek Ril&y stands here, guarding the courtyard entrance.&n
~
   A tall, very muscular lizard man, Lekessek in one of the members of the now defunct Circle of Fate. He 
joined the group shortly before their first big adventure when several of the members had been captured by his
tribe within the Teldescian Swamps. As part of the negotiation for the groups release, the clans best warrior
would fight a member of their choosing from the captives. If the clan champion won, the prisoners would be 
eaten as was customary of lizardmen. If the chosen champion won, all prisoners would be released and all 
equipment returned undamaged. Lekessek was the bravest and strongest of the lizardmen, and thus the obvious
choice to be their champion. As luck would have it, the clan chieftain chose Vorn Ul'Azzr to be his foe.
  The battle they fought lasted several hours. Even the oncoming darkness afforded the keen sighted lizardman
no advantage, and it soon became apparent that he was giving ground and would soon lose the battle. In a 
desperate attempt to win, Lekessek unleashed a violent volley upon his drow enemy, but in the end a black 
blade hovered at his throat, poised to end his life. In shame the lizardman lowered his head, welcoming death 
for his dishonor. Instead, Vorn sheathed his blade, and turned to leave the encampment with his friends. 
  The lizardman clan did allow the adventurers to leave, but they also cast out Lekessek as well. In order to
repay the drow for his new life, the lizardman vowed an oath to save the drows life and appease his honor. 
Over the next several years, Lekessek saved the drow many times, but still did not feel a desire to leave the
group. They had become a family, a group of outcasts, and even now the man called Lekessek guards the halls
of his friends, forever protecting them from any harm that may befall them.
