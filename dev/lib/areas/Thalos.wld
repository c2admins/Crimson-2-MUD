The Grand Gate of Thalos~
     You stand in the archway of a gigantic stone archway. The two
steel gates have been forced open and have rusted in place. A hollow
gust of wind blows by you into the deserted, and seemingly destroyed,
city.

Long benches lie toppled and the altar desicrated. Large chunks of stone
