Entrance to the Keep~
You are standing outside of a giant set of gates leading up to a treacherous looking keep. Behind the gates there is a drawbridge across a deep deadly looking moat. The gates are open, enter at your own risk!

On a drawbridge across a deadly moat~
Your standing on a wooden drawbridge, it doesn't look like it functions correctly anymore as there doesn't appear to be a way to raise it. As you look over the side into the moat you realize its a really long fall that would probably lead to your death. In front of you is the gate to the keep, it is unlocked.
