mob groulsch fearsome~
A fearsome groulsch~
A fearsome groulsch blinks at you stupidly.
~
The groulsch is an odd creature looking like an unholy cross between about
five different animals from the wilds of home.  It stands on four legs
and has a short, thick tail behind it.  It's fur looks as if it has
been slicked back by some accreted fluid to form a hard, bony plating across
it's body and there is a bony armoured plate around it's neck and head.

A small hideous demon~
A small hideous demon grins at you.
~
You are looking at a very ugly little demon, about 4 feet tall and with
a thin spiky tail.  It has a roughly humanoid shape, but it's skin is 
black and looks as if it is accreting a thick goo, almost like sap from
a tree.

mob Baz'lon paranoid demon~
Baz'lon, the Paranoid~
Baz'lon the Paranoid is running scared.
~
Strange, and freakish, Baz'lon awaits his punishment.  He is tormented by the visions
of his end.  You can see he cowers and cringes, and runs in fear.
The blackened skin he wears is from the burning fires he has been subjected to.
The yellow skin is from the chemical poisons that have been driven into him.
He is truely a mess.

Jal'Ra the Dark stands here, amongst the fleshy humanoids of this realm.
~
Before you stands a darkened figure.  He's a demon, standing with large massive horns, cloaked in darkness.  You notice scars over his body, having fought several battles in these hellacious planes.  He stands so tall, it almost seems like he could literally crush you before you even brandished your weapon.
