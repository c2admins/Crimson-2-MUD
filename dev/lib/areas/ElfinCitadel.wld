Near the Elfin Citadel~
You have wandered onto the grounds of the great Elfin Citadel.  To the north,
you see the large structure with protruding balconies, and large moat
surrounding.  From this direction, you sense a great feeling of happiness
and joy.  As your curiosity inspires you to go east, you notice an old
sign that has almost completely fallen to the ground.  It reads:
CAUTION: STRANGE MAGICAL POWERS LIE TO THE EAST!!!
You also see something carved into a rock by your feet.

On the Drawbridge~
You are on the drawbridge, which you judge to be able to support 1000
men your size.  It is made of solid iron, and appears to be well maintained.
You are thankful for this because of the unnfriendly moat which lurks
below you on both sides!

The Great Entryway to the Elfin Citadel.~
As you look around you, you sense the power of the kind Elfin people.  
While they represent good, you would not want to get on their bad side!
The tapestries and furniture make the entryway even more grand than you
had imagined.  There is a large chandelier above you.  It emits a
soft glow of white light, covering the room like an angel's wing.
To the east, there is some kind of lounge area; to the west,
there is room that overlooks the moat, and to the north lies the dining area.

To the west, the base of a stairwell is hidden by a curtain.

The Supervisor's Bedroom~
The furnishing here is more than sufficient, but not nearly as expensive as
what is noticable throughout much of the castle.  The Supervisor appears to be
a rather plain man, as his room isn't very colorfull.  Instead it is mainly
decorated in black marble with white furniture.

A prison cell in the dungeon of the Citadel~
You are in the cell... you blood freezes, as you see the scratch marks on the
walls.  The animal in this room has spent many years trying to break out.
You fear for your life that you, yourself might become trapped in here.
