&GStanding in Front of a Large Statue&n~
&gThe flowered garden parts to reveal a clearing dominated by a &wlarge statue&g of a strikingly beautiful 
elven woman. She wears no armor, nor are any weapons visible. She only wears simple lookign robes that hang 
loosely around her delicate frame. A look of sadness is upon her face, and her arms lay outstretched as if
she were reaching out for something that is no longer there. A &ylarge plaque&g lies imbedded into the base
of the statue, upon which appears to be writing.
  The rest of the surrounding area is far less dreary than the stone figure. Several benches sit near the 
edges of the circular clearing, most partially shaded to provide comfort from the late day sun. A stone walk-
way forms in a semicicular pattern around the outer edges, up to the base of the statue, providing a neat, 
maintained appearance for the gardens. The aroma of the nearby flowers also fills the air, their intoxicating
aroma provinding a peaceful, relaxed feel to the whole area.&n

&gThe flowered garden parts to reveal a clearing dominated by a &wlarge statue&g of a cloaked figure. A hood hides
the statues face, but from the the garb is typical to that of Rangers that populate the surrounding areas. A
beautifully crafted blade lies half drawn, the detail of which is breathtaking. The tunic that is worn by the
statue bears the emblem of &KBrimstone&g,  sword pointed downward between a set of glowing eyes. In all the
statue is so masterfully created that it almost seems alive. A large plaque lies embedded into its base, upon
which appears to be writing.
  The rest of the surrounding area is just as magnificent as the stone figure. Several benches sit near the 
edges of the circular clearing, most partially shaded to provide comfort from the late day sun. A stone walk-

  &gWell traveled and neatly bordered by large &Wma&wrb&Wle&wd s&Wton&wes&g, the pathway to the castle meanders up the
cliffside in an 'S' pattern. From this close vantage point, the immense size of the stronghold is breathtaking,
and it's beauty cannot be seen from within the city confines itself. Huge &wstone slabs&g, some nearly six feet
in width make up the outer walls, with towers at each end that climb nearly seventy feet in the air. Next to 
the giant iron gates that are the entry to the castle stand two huge stone figures, apparent statues that 
appear from this distance to be likenesses of typical Brimsonian guards. The castle looks like it would take a 
lifetime to build, and it's a true testiment to the people of this city that it only took a decade to create.&n

&n  The towering thirty foot gates dwarf the stone figures that are its guardians. The &Wma&wrb&Wle&wd s&Wton&wes&n
that dot the pathway leads right up to the gates, and provide a rather eclectic atmosphere as one approaches 
the castle walls. The gates themselves are made of iron, and stand open so that the public may enter. Sounds
of steel clashing on steel can be heard from within, but they are more like the sounds of practice instead of

&KA Dark Tunnel Leading to the Castle&n~
 &K  One of the greatest castle defenses, this tunnel slants in a downward direction. Should an enemy ever 
break through the first gate, they would not only find themselves worn out by the long climb up to the second
gate, but a very slippery situation as well. Lining the walls are several 'windows' , behind which lie small
enclosed rooms with steaming hot oil. In theory, if the oil were poured through the windows and into the 
tunnel, those inside would start slipping and falling back out to the primary gates, and with luck, off the 
cliffside to certain death. Luckily, though, this defense system has never needed to be tested on a real foe.&n

&KStanding Before a Second Set of Gates&n~
&K A large iron porticullis bars off access to the castle courtyard and the buildings beyond. In 
times of defense, this gate would be the last hope of the people before the castle would be 
overrun, and the cities hopes shattered. This, of course, would mean that whoever reached these
gates would have to survive rolling boulders, burning oil and the scores of arrows, which is no 
small feat. After reaching this point they would find themselves trapped behind these iron bars 
with no apparent way of raising them save brute strength or dumb luck. Even should some happless
soul make it into the courtyard, there would still be golems, archers and legions of warriors to
break through before making it to the doors of the castle itself. An assualt upon Brimstone seems
a hopeless task, and that's one of the reasons the city has flourished as a diplomatic host.&n

&wThe Castle &GCourtyard&n~
&g  The small &Kdark tunnel&g to the south gives way to a small &wcobblestone path&g that leads north to
a rather &Wlarge fountain&g in the center of the courtyard. From there the path circles the fountain
and continues north, stopping just before the &ydoors&g of the palace itself. Short, well cropped 
&Ggrass sections&g cover the remainer of the courtyard, and several &ytrees&g have been planted in random
locations to give the area a more lively look. Several &yworn patches of dirt&g lead up to the numerous
buildings linked to the courtyard, and a large pile of &wstone bricks&g near one of the easternmost 
structures gives evidence that the construction is not yet finished. Many of the visitors like to watch the
warriors train in the large building to the west, while most of the children prefer to watch the &Kblacksmith&g
shoe horses in the stables to the east. Still others like to watch the archers practice on the targets along 
the northwest wall, or even just read a book on one of the many &ybenches&g that line the pathway. Everyone
is welcome to come here at any time and for any reason. The &ycastle doors&g are always open for the council
to listen to any and all problems.
