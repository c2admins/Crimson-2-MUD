~
  Here before you stands seven and half feet of bone crunching muscle.  His dark grey skin has 
been weathered over the years and looks tough as granite, while his long black hair is tied 
neatly behind his head with a simple leather strip.  Large, black pupiless eyes stare at you 
with a warmth and compassion not normally seen in trolls, but this is no ordinary troll.  Telsek 
is known in these parts as one of the Circle of Fate.  A band of adventurers that formed this 
fair city in the hopes that renegades and outcasts could lead decent lives.

&YHordrinn Mellick&y stands here, proudly displaying his wares.&n 
~
  A tall, yet somewhat dumpy looking gnome, Hordrinn is reknowned around the lands as one of the shrewdest 
beings when it comes to running shops. When the fair city of Brimstone first opened its gates, Hordrinn was one
of the first in line to lobby for shop applications. In the days to come, each lobbiest was tested in various
sales techniques, and Hordrinn so outpaced his competition, that he was given the first shop several days before
the contest was scheduled to end. Since this time, the gnome has gained a hefty reputation as a shrewd, but very
fair owner, and is one of the more respected members of the city.

~
  Known as the friendliest of all the Brimstone shopkeepers, Gallack greets all who enter his establishment with
a warm smile. He is rather short for a gnome, standing just over three feet tall, and has often been mistaken 
for a Kender because of his 'packrat' habits. He doesn't seem to mind though, and spends most of his days 
collecting and selling rare and strange items he runs across. Since the gnome is not always aware of what he is
selling, a wary eye could fetch a real good bargain in this store.

&YShearra Kas'rin'nd&y stands here, patiently waiting to assist you.&n
~
  Shearra, like her friend Telsek, is one of the original members of the Circle of Fate, and a founder of the
city of Brimstone. Her unwillingness to become a public figure, but strong devotion to her friends led her to 
set up a shop here so that she could continue practicing her witchcraft. The young? elf stands just over five 
feet tall, with jet black hair and deep, mesmerizing blue eyes. Her beauty is rivaled only by Magick and 
Silvanya, but Shearra carries herself in such a way that she doesn't seem to notice. She spends most of her 
time here in her shop, brewing potions and infusing items with magical power, but upon occasion she will 
venture back to her old home in the Teldescian swamps to procure some needed components.

&YBrillo Harthgood&y patiently stands here, waiting for you to make a selection.&n
~
  Standing just over three feet tall, Brillo is the epitome of a halfling. He always seems to have a cheery 
disposition, even during the leanest of times. He makes it a point to greet every customer with a smile, for he
believes that attitude is half of a sale, and a saleman he is. Of all the shopkeepers in Brimstone, Brillo is 
probably the most liked. He can be seen many a day conversing with patrons, getting to know his customers and 
establishing a good relationship in order to maintain customers. Though the halfling has a number of employees,
he still insists on managing the store, and can be found here at all hours of the day or night.

~
  Once a rather famous trainer in a circus, Katiana has since decided to settle down and open a pet shop. Her
abilities to train animals is rivaled only by Rangers, but each pet she sells is guaranteed to be loyal for 
life. 
  Katiana is a tall, proud woman, standing just over six feet tall. She has short cropped blonde hair, and 
steel grey eyes. A scar runs down her right cheek to her jawbone, no doubt caused by one of the animals she 
trained in the past. Beneath her gruff appearance, Katiana is a kind and gentle woman. She is so fond of the 
animals she trains that they roam freely around her store for any who enter to examine.

Telsek, and the two can often be seen conversing during latter parts of the day about various tanning 
techniques, as well as forging and smithing.

  Not an overly large, or strong gargoyle, Redric found he had a knack for business at a young age. When the
city of Brimstone first opened its gates, he was one of the first to apply for shop ownership, but during the
trials he scored very poorly, and thus was left with a rather poor income store. You'll never hear him 
complain, however, for he has developed a taste for his wine products, and can often be caught 'tasting' his
samples to insure their quality.

  Drakes are very common in Torindrel, and come in all shapes and sizes.  The ones sold in most pet shops (like 
this one) stand about one and a half feet tall at the shoulder, and walk on all fours.  Their scales are a deep 
forest green, and unlike their larger cousins, they don't have wings.  In all other respects, however, they look 
like small dragons.

&YElrin Bath'Inor&y stands here, a sly grin upon his face.&n
~
  Elrin never had a knack for adventure. What he did love, however, was gold and jewels, or anything that 
glittered or glistened. During his brief career, the darkling amassed a fair sized fortune, and loved showing
off his prized trinkets to guests to his home near the Arten Mountains. When brimstone first opened its gates,
an associate of Elrin suggested he apply for a shop to increase his wealth. Never one to turn down an oppor-
tunity to make a profit, the darkling signed for the tournament that was being held, and during the trials 
finished in the top five. Since opening his store, Elrin has become a master at turning a profit, but a nasty
runin with a Teldescian troll has ensured that he is fair with all his customers.

&YCorindel Angsfar&n~
&YCorindel Angsfar&y stands here, waiting for a customer.&n
~
  A very tall and powerful looking half-giant, Corindel is very gentle in nature despite his intimidating
appearance. He grew up in the town of Moonsilver with a human farming couple, the only family he has ever 
known since he was abandoned on their doorstep shortly after birth. Though his giant heritage is apparent, he
has accepted his adoptive parents as his true family and does not ask about his origins. When he was young,
Corindel loved to ride the horses at the farm. As he began to grow, however, the horses became too small to 
support his weight, and there were no other animals in the community that could support him. Instead of giving
up, the youth instead enlisted the aid of a local wizard, who to specialized in enlargement spells. It wasn't
long before the two of them were able to breed a stock of 'giant' horses, but the problem still remained with
saddling the large beasts. The resourceful giant found a leatherworker, and had a saddle specially made for 
himself and his new steeds. Once again able to ride, Corindel's elation dispersed as he realized that the 
problem he had must exist throughout the realm. Set on correcting the problem, he found himself upon the steps
of Brimstone Castle, where a tournament was being held for shop liscences in the newly formed city. Seizing 
the opportunity, he half-giant entered the tournament, but soon found he was overmatched by skilled merchants
who were schooled in trade. In a desperate gamble, the youth made a plea to the council of Brimstone, laying
out his ideas and aspirations, pouring everything he had into a grand speech. The council approved his ideas,
and Coridels store has become reknowned throughout the lands for its advancements in riding equipment.
