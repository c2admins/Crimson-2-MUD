Cave Entrance~
You have come across a rather large entrance to some interesting looking
caverns.  It appears as though the path into this cave has been traveled
recently.  But the spacing between the most recent of footprints suggest 
a race of short beings.  You feel compeled to venture further into the cave.

In this room there is a large table with various maps placed on it.  The 
walls are lined with official looking documents and more maps.  Some dwarves
are here studying the maps and appearantly planning some sort of attack.  
There are several guards here fully armed and armored, they seem to be 
expecting an assault at any moment.

Bazzakrak Hall Council Meeting Room~
Upon entering you are impressed by the size of this room.  There is a large
marble table in the center of the room surrounded by seven chairs.  One of
the chairs seems to be much more lavishly decorated than the rest, it
probably belongs to the ruler of this dwarven town.  The table and chairs are
surrounded by many rows of smaller chairs.  This room looks large enough to
seat at least two-thirds the town.  A small exit leads off to the south.

The Dwarven King's Room~
This room is much larger than some of the other dwarven residenances that you
have been to.  There is a window that overlooks an indoor gardin.  There are
many displays of various scluptures of gold and silver that line the walls of
this room.  One of the scluptures seems oddly out of place here.

The King's Treasure Room~
As you enter this room, it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the 
almost complete darkness in this room.  There are several large chests laying
on the floor.  Judging by the one open crate, the rest are likely filled with
gold or silver.  A few small pieces of gold nuggets remain scattered amoung
the chests.
