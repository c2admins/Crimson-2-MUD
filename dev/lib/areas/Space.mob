Sparky and most known fairy dragons is the fact that one has never been known
to stay loyal to one person for very long before, but Sparky almost seems
like Silthanus's pet.

A gigantic frog is hoping around making the ground shake with each hop.

   This is Slog's enormous pet frog.  It hops up and down causing
monstrous tremors beneath your feet.  Each of its loud ribbits are
nearly ear shattering.  You better hope that it doesn't think you
are a fly, or your gonna be lapped up.

Eric Draven~
Eric Draven stands here, a crow perched upon his shoulder.
~
   Deep brown eyes stare out from the wet black hair that falls
to the shoulders of this very handsome man.  White paint is laid
onto his face perfectly, black lines go up and above and below his
eyes, and also side to side on either end of, and under and above,
his lips.  A long sleeved black shirt is worn on his upper body,
and black leather pants cover his legs.  A long black trenchcoat is
worn over this all, and boots of the same color fitted his feet.  Black
electric tap runs over his hands like fingerless gloves.  A crow is
perched upon his shoulder.  It caws, and looks deep into your eyes.

A rather plump Thanksgiving turkey rests here, awaiting its holiday fate.
As you get ready to carve into the sweet, sweet meat, it surprises you and
says, "If you spare my life, I will transform you into a mighty chimera. Or
I will bless you. Heck, I could give you a recall, if you want."
