a scything blade swings down from the ceiling to cleave you neatly in half
vertically as another one swings out from the wall to do the same

wall, each one sticking perfectly into one of your pressure points.

you back to where you were before.  Can't Move!  No Exits!  You have only one

damage each but there are so many of them, they manage to kill you before you
have a chance to react.  You'll be happy to know that your corpse will keep
the insects well fed until there next victum arrives.  I guess the double

labeled, telling what each animal is trained to do.  Just when you thought
you were safe, you notice a LARGE black cat lying in the back of the room.

open the door.  Nice job!  Well, time to pay the price as the worm comes

The Lady's Chamber.~
   You have just entered an elaborately decorated bedroom.  There is a 
large bed in the center of the room.  The walls have murals painted on 
them and there is a portrait of a beautifull woman hanging over the bed.
That same woman is lying on the bed before you.  She wears nothing but 
a red, lacey teddy and her beauty gets your heart racing.  Just as you
began to think that you are in heaven, she pulls a strange looking 
dagger out from under her pillow and jumps forth at you.  She was 
searching for fresh blood and you just answered her call (of course,
being a thief, she wants all your stuff too).  Doh!  Women!  You can't
live without and she is trying to make you die with them.
