mob emonds villager~
an Emond's Field villager~
The villager has an uneasy look in his eye as he hurries about his business.
~
He is pretty ordinary in appearance although, like many of the people from
this area, he has sandy brown hair and hazel eyes.  As you look closer at him
you sense he is uneasy about something.  He won't look you in the eye and appears
preoccupied with something else as he greets you.

mob perrin aybara lord wolf~
Lord Perrin Goldeneyes~
Wolf Lord Perrin Aybara, aka. Goldeneyes, glares at you from his makeshift throne.

At first glance, you see a hard, inwardly drawn man with curly hair and a scruffy
beard.  His piercing gold eyes are unlike anything you've ever seen and they
frighten you immensely.  His entire personality radiates power and respect.  You
fell awed in his presence.

mob faile lady~
The Lady Faile~
The beautiful lady Faile, Perrin's wife, stands stoically beside his throne.
~
Faile is a petite, dark skinned woman with tilted eyes.  Her casual glance tells
more then an average observer might notice.  She looks like she knows something
no one else does and you feel like in the brief few moments you've been here, 
she has stripped you down and analyzed your every being.  Creepy....

Thom the gleeman~
Thom, the gleeman, wanders around performing for the villagers.
~
Thom is an old man with gray hair and a slight limp.  He has piercing blue eyes
that belie a kindness not seen by many.  But don't let his age fool you, his

indeed.

Master Luhhan~
The local blacksmith, Master Luhhan, glares at you from across the table.
~
Whoa is this guy big!  He stands well over 6 feet tall and has arms as thick
as your legs.  His voice is gruff as he accusingly asks what you are doing
here.  He doesn't appear pleased that you stumbled upon his hiding place.

mob mat cauthon~
Mat Cauthon~
Mat Cauthon eyes you suspiciously from the bed.
~
He has dark hair and dark eyes.  He has a cockiness about him that
you find rather appealing and immediately find yourself warming to
his personality.  He looks young, maybe early 20's, yet his eyes
tell of experiences seen by few others.  Don't underestimate him
because of his boyish good lucks.
