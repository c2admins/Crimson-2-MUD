&yGate &wof&n &YChocobos&n ~
&nBefore you is a giant &ygate&n unlike any other that you have seen.
It seems to be made of rather large &Yyellow&n &ybirds&n.  Each of
these &Ybirds&n has 3 &wrazor&n sharp &Kclaws&n, 2 pointed forward
and one back.  Their &ybeaks&n are just as sharp as their &Kclaws&n,
and are slightly darker in color than the rest of their bodies.
As you approach the gate it begins to open slowly.  As the
gate creeks open, you hear a faint screeching "waaaarrrrrrkkk".  As
you walk past the gate you glance down and notice a &bswir&Wling&n
&Cportal&n at your feet.

Welcome to &BFin&Cal&n &CFan&Btasy&n ~
&nYou must have entered the &Cportal&n because the world around 
you has completely transformed.  Reality, time, and space all converge 
and you are lost in a void.  You begin to give up hope when suddenly 
you pop back into existence.  You are no longer in the forest however, 
rather in a completely different land composed solely of final fantasy.  
As you look around, you recognize relics, armors, and weapons all from 
classic Final Fantasy games.  Appearing before you is Mog, and he says 
"choose your scenario, kupo".  To the East you hear the deranged 
laughter of &RK&pe&Rf&pk&Ra&n as he commits unthinkable acts.  
To the West you see huge mako reactors draining the Earth of her life 
force.  To the South, is the land from which you came and to which 
you shall return!

Entrance to &WNa&wrs&Whe&n~
Standing before you is the town of Narshe.  Once a thriving mining 
town, Narshe has been caught in the middle of a war, and all mines 
have been sealed off in fear of invasion by the empire.  The elder has 
so far barely been able to remain neutral in the conflict with the empire, 
but with the discovery of an Esper, it looks as if Emporer Gestahl and 
the returners both have their eyes set on this once peaceful town.  You 
can hear the sound of advanced machinery rumbling in the background, 
and see hot steam pouring into the streets out of huge vents.

The entrances to the mines have been boarded up to keep people out 
for their own safety.  Legends speak of a giant Sasquatch that lives 
somewhere within, however no one has actually seen it.  Peering 
through the boards, you can see very little light inside, and wonder just 
how deep these mines actually go.  Suddenly your eyes spy a small gap 
you can squeeze into.

Despite all odds you managed to survive your journey through the 
desert, and you have found Figaro Castle.  Figaro Castle is so hi-tech 
that it's able to submerge and travel underground past the mountains 
of the west to the land of Kohlingen.  Extending out of each side of the 
castle are two massive towers with one right in the middle.  It's said 
that when the castle submerges these towers all converge in the middle 
of the castle and it sinks into the ground.  Just recently the Imperial 
court mage, &RK&pe&Rf&pk&Ra&B came to Figaro to find Terra. Although Edgar 
insisted Terra wasn't there, &RK&pe&Rf&pk&Ra&B remained suspicious, and set fire to 
the castle. The castle burrowed underground while Edgar, Terra and 
Locke fled to Figaro cave.  A few guards can be seen patrolling the 
outside of the castle.

up to you and says "Welcome to Figaro Castle, due to a recent attack by 
&RK&pe&Rf&pk&Ra&B most of the castle has been blocked off.  We apologize for the 
inconvenience and hope you enjoy your stay."  Looking straight ahead 
you see you will reach the throne room, and to the left is the magic 
lever that engages the submerging system.  When engaged the castle 
has ability to burrow under the desert and travel under the western 
mountains to Kohlingen.

Throne Room~
When the late king of Figaro died, it was rumored he was poisoned by
the Empire. The king's final wish was that the kingdom be ruled jointly 
by his two sons, Edgar and Sabin. Sabin was disgusted with the 
kingdom's focus on the king's successor rather than his death, and 
told Edgar he wished to flee to the mountains. Edgar told Sabin they 
would decide what they would do via a coin flip. The winner could 
leave, while the loser would remain to rule Figaro. Edgar used a 
two-headed coin to ensure Sabin's win, and Sabin opted to leave and 
live freely.  Ten years later, Edgar is publicly allied with the Empire
while secretly supplying resources to the Returners, a rebel faction, 
using Locke as a go-between. The Empire likewise intended to lie 
about making an allegiance. When a young woman, Terra, is rescued 
by Locke in Narshe after escaping the Empire, Locke takes her to 
Figaro for shelter where they attempt to convince her to join the 
Returners.

The Story~
Long Ago, the War of the Magi reduces the world to a scorched wasteland, and 
magic simply ceased to exist. 1000 Years have passed... Iron, gun powder and 
steam engines have been rediscovered, and high technology reigns... But there 
are some who would enslave the world by reviving the dread destructive force 
known as "magic". Can it be that those in power are on the verge of repeating a 
senseless and deadly mistake?

Along with South Figaro, Kholingen is nominally governed by 
the Figaros.  It is located in the northwest corner of the world, 
and is Rachel's hometown. The town and its history are integral 
to understanding Locke's past and motivations.

The pub of South Figaro has had its rumors circling around for years.  
Entering the pub you find the rumors are true.  Assassins and thieves 
are all around you getting drunk and picking fights.  Although the town 
has been occupied by the empire, this area remains unpatrolled.  In 
the corner of the room you notice one of the assassins sitting quietly 
with his drink.  At this man's feet lies a huge dog, snarling in it sleep.  
As you take in the scenery you get hit by a bottle, and decide maybe it's 
best for you to leave.

Duncan ran a dojo at Duncan's Cabin outside of South Figaro
near Mt. Kolts where he trained students in the martial arts. 
His two star pupils were his son Vargasand Sabin Rene Figaro. Sabin 
and Vargas were rivals, and argued over who would take Duncan's 
place as the new master. Each insisted Duncan favored the other. 
Vargas, convinced Sabin was to be chosen, apparently killed his 
father.  Duncans wife however, insists that he's still alive!

In his youth, Locke used to travel with his father, who was a treasure 
hunter. His father died and people in Kohlingen treated Locke like a 
common thief. Rachel was the only one not to consider him as such, 
and they fell in love, but her father detested him. To prove himself to 
Rachel's father, Locke explored a dangerous cave with her.  A 
bridge crumbled under Locke, and Rachel, out of love and devotion, 
rushed to save him. She fell and was almost killed.  Locke rescued 
her and took her home and nursed Rachel back to health, but she 
developed a case of amnesia.

Blaming Locke for her condition, Rachel's father threw him out and 
Rachel agreed, as she had lost her memory of their relationship. The 
village turned against Locke, who left Kohlingen. Locke felt guilty for 
Rachel's loss of memory, and tried to redeem himself by protecting 
every woman he came across. One day, Kohlingen was destroyed in 
an Imperial attack, and Rachel was murdered, but not before 
recovering her memory and declaring her love for Locke, who joined 
the Returners to help the resistance against the Empire.

only airship, would be attempting to kidnap Maria from a performance 
of the opera, Locke comes up with the idea of disguising Celes, who 
looks just like Maria, as the star of the opera so Setzer would abduct 
her instead of the real Maria. Celes and the Impressario are initially 
hesitant, but eventually agree.

an oil lamp.  It looks as if he's in the process of packing up his personal 
belongings.  Looking around further you notice a small note lying on 
the table requesting that Leo returns to the empire to meet with the 
emperor.

Sabin and Shadow infiltrate the base to get to Baren Falls and the Veldt, 
and bear witness to Kefka plotting to poison the river that is Doma's 
water supply. Leo rejects Kefka's plan, but is called away by Emperor
Gestahl. In his absence, Kefka goes ahead with his plan despite the 
attempts of Sabin and Shadow to stop him. The poisoning kills the vast 
majority of Doma's citizens, and Cyan storms the camp on his own in a 
rage. Sabin and Shadow intervene to help him, and the three 
commandeer three suits of Magitek Armor and fight their way out of 
the camp.

children, and the elderly. Imperial troops still roam the streets making 
some reluctant to venture outside.

The Magi, humans who could use magic, were persecuted for their
abilities and hunted down and executed. A handful of them escaped
and founded Thamasa well away from civilization to live in peace.
The descendants of the Magi retain the ability to use magic, but it is
weaker than their ancestors' as the bloodlines have waned.

his new family, Shadow fled the town with the family dog, Interceptor
hoping his daughter and her mother could live a normal life without

as a granddaughter. This is why, when the party first visits Thamasa
Interceptor is so friendly with Relm.

Born to a military family in the southern state of what would 
become Vector in the Gestahlian Empire several decades ago
Gestahl's father was involved in a military coup while he was 13  
years old, and Gestahl crowned Emperor some time later. During his  
time as Emperor, Gestahl researched ancient tales of magic and 
sorcery, looking for truth behind the tales. The exact details of  
Gestahl's rise to power outside of his father being involved in a 
are unknown, but he came to lead Vector some time before his  
scholars located the portal to the land of the espers beyond the Cave 
to the Sealed Gate. Gestahl led a raid to capture espers, but he and 
his troops were ejected when the esper elder cast a spell to seal the  
gate. In the chaos, the esper Maduin and a human woman Madeline  
were swept out and, outside the gate, Gestahl found Madeline's  
daughter, Terra and took her, Maduin and the other captured espers  
back to Vector.

and confront Gestahl who uses the power of the Triad to paralyze

Gestahl and Kefka hand Celes a sword and offer her the chance to
rule the world with them if she proves her loyalty and dispatches her
friends, as well as hinting that Gestahl desires for Celes and Kefka
to produce Magitek progeny. Celes refuses and stabs Kefka who
flies into a rage and demands the Warring Triad to reveal their true power.

unnamed sorcerer engaged Odin, and against this sorcerer, the
Zantetsuken failed. Odin was petrified and the castle was defeated.
The Queen of the castle was also petrified in the dungeon in the
castles east wing. She loved Odin, a forbidden love due to it being
between a human and an esper, but vowed to confess her feelings to
him once the war was over. At some point before the main story, the
castle somehow sank into the ground.

In ancient times the Warring Triad feared each others power and
started a war. The humans and animals caught in the crossfire
became espers and were enslaved by the gods to fight for them.
Eventually the gods realized the chaos their fighting was causing and
sealed themselves in stone, their final act to give the espers free will
and ask them to protect them from being awoken. After the War of
the Magi, the espers fled the world to a new realm and took the
Warring Triads petrified statues with them. The Triad was placed in a
delicate balance of power, and it is said catastrophe would occur if
they were ever moved out of position.

Kefka uses the power of the Triad in the World of Ruin to exert his
destructive will on any city that resists him, using a ray of energy
called the Light of Judgment to burn anyone who opposes him, or
destroy entire towns. When the party raids Kefkas Tower with hopes
of defeating Kefka, they destroy the Triad to get rid of Kefkas power
source. This worries Terra, who is half-esper and half-human. The
Triad are the source of magic, and thus the espers life force. If the
Triad were destroyed espers would die, possibly including Terra. By
this point Kefka had drained most of the Triad's power into himself
and thus had become the source of magic. After Kefka is defeated
Terra survives as a human without the espers innate magical abilities
because of her strong feelings for the children in Mobliz.

A thousand years later a man named Gestahl rediscovered the
secrets of magic. He built up an Empire and invaded the esper world,
kidnapping espers and draining their powers, resulting
in Magitek. Kefka Palazzo was aware of the Warring Triads
existence, as he was maniacally reveling in his increase in power and
mentioned his plans to reawaken the Warring Triad within
the Magitek Research Facility. After discovering magicite, the true
power of the espers, Gestahl invades the Land of Espers with Kefka
raising the Floating Continent with the Warring Triads power at his
fingertips. Kefka seizes the Triads power for himself and uses it to
murder Gestahl. Kefka succeeds in moving the Statues out of
alignment, releasing their power, shifting the face of the world, and
conquering the world.

the floating island. Kefka moves the Triad out of alignment, shattering
their delicate magical field. Shadow and the Returners narrowly

The castle was attacked during the War of the Magi, and in the heat
of the battle, the only esper left to fight was Odin. Odin engaged the
enemy army and felled several soldiers using the Zantetsuken, but an
unnamed sorcerer engaged Odin, and against this sorcerer, the
Zantetsuken failed. Odin was petrified and the castle was defeated.
The Queen of the castle was also petrified in the dungeon in the
castles east wing. She loved Odin, a forbidden love due to it being
between a human and an esper, but vowed to confess her feelings to
him once the war was over. At some point before the main story, the
castle somehow sank into the ground.

You are in an area that has only been imagined.  It doesn't
actually exist and for you to be here is impossible yet you are.
