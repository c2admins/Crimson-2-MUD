&wUnstable Ground&n~
&KYou find yourself in a cramped, cold lair.  The world has become warped in here, and you notice a small lurking man in a corner just ranting on and on to things you can't see.  He just sits there carrying on a conversation with nothing in front of him.  You've found yourself inside the lair of someone very unstable.&k

&wTrapped Under &CI&cc&Ce&n~
&KYou've fallen into the ground.  A deep, dark hole is all you recognize yourself as being in.  You hear a very loud growl come from inside, the hair on your neck stands at end.  It approaches slow and methodically.  You notice fur first, then a bright gleam inside an eye.  Whatever's in here isn't happy.&n

&KAt the doorstep to &RVen&rgea&Rnce&n~
&Ka small twisted mask lies on the floor, spinning it's own web of deceit and trickery.  It knows what you have come for, as you enter it's lair it wants to you leave before it has to take out what is left inside of it.  The mask once human has taken this form to prevent further damage, which is why it carries a heavily armed sword and no conscience.&n
