&RThe Misty Landing of the Fallen&n~
&rYou enter a misty hallway, after being transported from the
world of the living. The half-dead humans that roam these halls
are a part of an evil alliance. They call themselves the fallen
and for good reason. They have been banished from the realms
of the kingdom and thrown into a vast void of torment. They walk
around seemingly as if they don't care about their lives, your life or
for that matter, any life at all

&wWritten Words of Silence&n~
&cYou find yourself at the bottom of a deep pit. All around you the
souls of damned men float about aimlessly, their fate sealed
by their actions as mortals. Here they must live out eternity
alone and deprived. Their mouths sealed for fear of their evil
tongues, a small board rests in the corner, their only way
to communicate

&CThe Chamber of the High Council&n~
&wAs you enter the room, the large oak door slams shut behind you.
As you turn, you find yourself facing the high council. You
try to make out their faces, but their hooded cloaks prevent
you from learning much more than the color of their skin. Across
the walls, huge weapon's racks hold some of the most powerful
items you've ever seen and mounted on the walls are the heads
of slain beasts, proclaiming the strength of the clan.

not even the fires of Hades can destroy the powerful armor
of some worlds. You find yourself in a vast armoury, filled
with the equipment of long dead men.

&RYou find yourself facing a huge onyx door. However beautiful
the inscriptions on it may be, there is little possibility
of you ever seeing the other side. Then, just as you turn to
leave the monstrocity, a powerful force from within swings
the door open. As you eyes adjust to the light, you realize
the power of the force within. Venturing forward into
the room you join the ranks of the other peasants awaiting
court with the lords of the realm.

&gThe Room of Painful Memories&n~
&wYou enter this room. It seems to bring back your vague, hidden
memories of childhood, your teenage years and all the years you
were tormented, hated, despised, and most of all, what you did
about it. You almost fall down weeping tears as all these feelings
come back, haunting you, tearing deep inside of you. It is
what you have tried to hide for so long, now it's been brought
back up to the surface for all to see. This pain you live with
isn't hidden, it's within the sight of plain eyes.

&wThe Darkest Pits of your Soul&n~
&cAs you enter the room, you realize it is not you who has entered,
but you that has entered. You can feel a force stronger than any
you have encountered creeping through the depths of your being.
As it tears at your mortal body, you fall to the ground writhering
in pain as you are devoured from the inside. As you release
your last breath, a feeling of great relief envelops you until
you realize that this was the very reason for your death. Before
you fully comprehend what's happening, the same force that destroyed
your body now consumes your soul and you become one of the

&wYou have entered a small cemetery of sorts. Scattered all around are the
&wtombstones of various children whose souls have fallen from the heavens
&wleft to wander for all eternity. This cemetery is where &rC&Ro&rl&Re&w draws
&whis strength and power from. In the center of the room lies A massive
&wtombstone inscribed with the words &rD&Re&ra&Rd&rm&Ra&rn&w walking. The tombstone appears
&wto have a hole front of it. As you walk closer you notice that one name
&wis scribed on the stone...&rC&Ro&rl&Re&w. Looking into the hole you see that the
&wcasket inside the hole is open and is empty. The &rd&Re&ra&Rd&rm&Ra&rn&w is free to roam

&KTHE-BIG-EMPTY&n~
&WYou have entered a sur-real void where reality seems to fade in and out.
A calm energy pulses around you and you wonder what this place is. As
you explore the seemingly endless void, you notice a few similarities in
the sur-realism. The madness around you also seems to flow in and
through you. Panic settles in. You being to search franticly for an
escape but none can be found. Wishing for death, you look for any way
out of this endless darkness, when suddenly a booming voice rises out of
the darkness. "You have entered the emptiness, My world, pain, love,
hate, all the same. If you wish to leave there is but one way out - To
believe in Nothing and accept that everything is Nothing. For only with
Nothing can anything be achieved."

&pT&Khe H&paven o&Kf H&pope S&Khattered&n~
&cAs you enter the room, you're engulfed by feelings of hope shattered
and souls broken.  The pictures of old heros, looking like ghosts of 
their former selves, line the black walls.  Sprinkles of light flutter
around the room.  One lands upon a picture and light floods the room.
Straight across is a comfortable chair that matches the wall, and 
almost blends in.  A table sits a few feet from it, the wood dark
maroon.  In one of the corners rests a large bed, covered in red.  You 
can't tell if it's blood, or just the color of the sheets.  And then 
you wonder if you want to know.&n

&cThe &WM&wi&Wl&wk&Wi&wn&Wg&c Room&n~
     As you pass through the portal, you senses go awry as you slowly regain them, you can hear the constant sounds of bonvines.  Although they seem to sound painstakinly disgruntled and crowded, it is not overly unpleasant.  As your vision slowly returns, you find yourself in the middle of a milking room.  Standing on a long narrow grated walkway, bovines fill either side of the room each in its individual stalls.  They barely pay any attention to you as they graze on the sweetened grain in front of them.   Long tubles with large nipples dangel from the udders and a constant suction can be heard.  As you progress down the isle, a cow stomps its foot sending &yburied treasure &ball over you.  Scraping away the remains of the bovines last meal from you eyes, you run into a ladder.  A welcoming escape from the filth and morbid moo of the bovines, you consider climbing although there appears to be a door at the far end of the room, too bad you did not bring your &Krubber boots.

Vampiro's Room~

You hear the voices of the highest choirs of angels, and their songs... It 
sounds so lovely, it just lures you into the room and you step inside this 
fairly small room.   As you do, you look up and see a coffin... You are 
worried, because the coffin is open, and there is only black satin and 
velvet interior, no occupant... You become worried, what if the one who rests 
here see you in his room?  That thought quickly passes as you gaze upon the 
rest of the room.  Its eloquently outfitted in the most Victorian style and 
mixed with the Germanic Visigoth styles.   Its a beautiful room with the 
flowing velvets, and the Blackwood table, covered in silver, crystal, and 
pewter.   There are two crystal glasses half filled with blood, and a silver 
pitcher next to them You look into the glass and realize this is no 
ordinary human blood, for it has white and gold flecks in it... You see a few 
feathers next to the glasses, which must be from one of the slain angels 
wings... And you slowly realize this blood is that of an angels... You wonder 
what it must taste like... You take a few steps closer...

most prized treasures. The floor is cluttered with countless other

Darch Omen Main Hall~

You find yourself in an almost pitch black room, luckily there are a few 
candles at the end of the hall that give off some light.   You utter some 
archaic words, and suddenly the candles surrounding the room are lit.   As 
you look towards the end of the hall, you see a cross hung upon the wall.   
Directly below the cross, you an altar... The altar is covered in black wax 
from candles burned to nothing now.   And, at the base of the altar you see 
a pentagram drawn on the floor... in what appears to be black blood.   On the 
left side of the hall, there are Ivory and gold inlayed caskets, and on the 
opposite side of the room, you see three coffins of marble studded with 
crimson rubies.   Along with those coffins, there is a pile of charred 
bodies... upon closer look, they are human bones, but they have fangs... There 
are small dried pools of blood scattered throughout the hall, along with 
feathers, and silver stakes, and swords... and you ever see a set of metal 
fingernails worn at one time on the hand of one of these creatures... You 
wonder what has happened here, and wonder if its safe here... you slowly take a 
few steps down the hall...

tell its none other then the box of Transitory Quests.  A very beautiful and 
intricate room indeed.  You see a few random pieces of powerful equipment 
scattered about like they are merely snotling equipment.  Its made clear to 
you that whoever pays homage here is very powerful... you best leave before

Scorched Horizon clannie room tunnel~

This quiet stone tunnel leads to hidden sanctuaries for Scorched Horizons clan members.
Branching north, south, east and west, with another passage down, this appears to be the
most secure area for members.  This bunker apparently serves to provide clan members with
living quarters, so they feel at home when they stop by.  You notice that the rooms have
lavish bunk beds of silk, feathers and fine furs.  So while clan members apparently have to
share, they are sharing luxurious nooks.  Not a bad deal, if I say so myself. ;)

Dairy Farm of DooM~

&KYour journey into the lifestyle of the &cScorched | Horizons&K has taken a fatal turn.  Upon 
your entrance the smell of putrid entrails overwhelms you.  To your left stands a ghastly 
remnant of a man named &RR&Ya&Rwhead&K.  In his outstretched hands lay the poor remains of some
mortal's entrails... it appears that he has been using them in some sort of sick &rsexual&K 
ritual. On the right, stands &WCr&Yi&Wonics&K surrounded by the corpses taken in our &rbloody&K 
conquests.  Upon the mound of putrid flesh, &WCow&K is crouching vomiting the vile &gbile&K of his 
latest meal.  When the dry heaving comes to a halt, he grabs his udders and strokes them in 
&WCr&Yi&Wonics&K direction.  &WCr&Yi&Wonics&K opens his mouth awaiting the gift of &WCow's milk&K.  Suddenly 
you wonder if you wandered into the wrong room as their eye set upon you.  Turning 
to run, you hear the hollowed screams of those still hanging onto what life is left in them, 
as the three advances over them your &rheart&K quickens with the thought of the unavoidable 
end of your life.
