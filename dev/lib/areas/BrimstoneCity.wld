&KTelsek's Fine Armours&n~
&c  This comfortable and cozy establishment has been kept clean and well maintained over the 
years. Metal armours of all kinds lay out for display, hanging from walls, and standing on
racks. The ownder of the shop is a very large, well groomed troll that goes by the name of 
Telsek B'rackt, a bit of a legend in these parts. He was part of the adventuring group that 
founded this city, but finding the political life distasteful, set up shop here to aid those who
were just beginning their lives of adventure. Telsek can be found here at all times of the day,
sitting patiently behind his counter, a warm and cheery smile upon his face. On top of the 
counter rests a small &Psign&c for those unfamiliar with how the shop operates.&n

&gFor Those of you unfamiliar with the workings of my shop, I provide you with the following help:

     If you wish to view the items that I currently have in stock type - &GLIST&g
     If you wish to purchase an item from my stock, type - &GBUY <item>&g

&G*NOTE*&g If more than one of a type of item exists in my inventory, you can purchase the item
       you wish by typing # of item.item  For example:
       I carry the following items:  suit of platemail          -  25000 gold
                                     glowing suit of platemail  - 50000 gold
                                     suit of green platemail    - 30000 gold

Let's say the item you wish to purchse is the glowing platemail. If you simply type  
'buy platemail' you would purchase the 'suit of platemail.' By typing 'buy 2.platemail' however,
you will purchse the desired item since the glowing platemail is second on the list as far as
platemail is concerned. Likewise to purchase the green platemail, you would type 'buy 
3.platemail'

     If you wish to sell an item from your inventory, use the command: &GSELL <item>&g

If you need any further assistance, please read the shops page of your beginners handbook, or
see other players for help. Thanks.&n

&KCentral Square&n~
&c   Standing amidst the ever increasing crowds of this magnificent city is a beautifully 
crafted marble fountain.  The citizens of Brimstone have become rather immune to its presense
as they go about their daily duties, but several visiting adventurers gape in awe at the 
wonderous elven craftmanship.  Few people remember the actual origins of the structure, but it
has been whispered that is was a gift from the king of the Quel'Sith elves to his two daughters
who reside in the castle to the north that watches over the city.&n

modest establishment.  The shop belongs to Hordrinn Mellick, a small gnome who is often described 
as kind and compassionate, but one of the shrewdest salesmen in all the lands.  He stands here 
behind his counter, patiently waiting to show you his finest weapons in stock.  A small &Psign&c

&gFor Those of you unfamiliar with the workings of my shop, I provide you with the following help:

If you wish to view the items I currently have for sale type - &GLIST&g
If you wish to purchase an item from the list, type - &GBUY <item>&g
&G*NOTE*&g - some items may have similar names. In this case you will need to view how many of
         item you want are similar, and purchase #.<item>. For example:
         The items I have in stock are: a short sword
                                        a serrated short sword
                                        a glowing short sword
         If you want to purchase the serrated short sword, you of course would not want to type
         buy short or buy sword because you would purchase the first item 'a short sword.' By 
         entering buy 2.short, or buy 2.sword however, you will buy the desired item because the
         serrated short sword is the second short and second sword on the weapons list.
If you wish to sell an item to me from your inventory, use the command - &Gsell <item>&g

&KShearra's Magicks&n~

potions, as well as other, more obscure(and somewhat illegal) magical items.  Most items are open to view and 
test for quality, but others have been placed behind the counter due to their wild powers, or dangerous 
properties.  Shearra Kas'rin'nd, an elf of amazing beauty, is the proprietor of this shop.  She can be found 
here at all times of the day and night, for magical spells and elven heritage mean she needs little sleep other 
than the occasional catnap between customers.  A small &n&Psign&n&c sits on the counter beside her, in case

establishment. Items ranging from fruits and vegetables to spiced meats are neatly packed and preserved 
on shelves to keep vermin away.  Brillo Harthgood, a cheerful little hobbit, can be found here at any time of 
day or night.  He happily greets anyone who enters with a fine '&yHullo&Y!&c', and then patiently waits for 
customers to examine his goods.  The wall to the south has been cut away, leaving a room beyond filled with 
barrels of water. A counter can be seem beyond the barrels, and signs seem to indicate some form of water shop
at that location. A small &Psign&c for the neophyte shopper sits on Brillo's counter, just begging to be read.&n

&gGreetings and Hullo brave adventurers! I am providing you with these simple instructions to help guide you 
through the hassles of buying and selling in the shops of Brimstone. Best of luck to you!:

To see what items I currently have in stock, type &GLIST&g
To purchase an item I have in my inventory, type &GBUY <item>&g or &GBUY #.<item>&g
  For example, lets say I carried the following list of breads:
    loaf of white bread  - 25 gold
    loaf of wheat bread  - 30 gold
    a pipeweed bread     - 45 gold

  If you wished to buy the pipeweed bread, you could enter either &Gbuy pipeweed&g or &Gbuy 3.bread&g
  Buy pipeweed works because none of the other items contain that keyword, and since pipeweed is the third 
  bread on the list, buy 3.bread works as well. It's best to check similar or like keywords before purchasing
  any items.

To sell items from your inventory, type &GSELL <item>&g

   Liam is a small, very docile cat.  He's used to customers coming in and out of the shop, and also the 
the constant presense of the other animals.  He usually doesn't move from his 'perch' on top of the counter, 
keeping an eye on the other animals to insure none bolt out the door to escape.  In appearance, he resembles a
cross between an elven lynx and a smaller domestic long-haired cat. He maintains the long, pointed ears of his 
lynx heritage, as well as the dark intelligent eyes.  His coat, however, is a sheer silky black that hangs 
loosly about his body.  His claws have been removed, so no customer need fear him, but he doesn't look that

&KRedric's Water Supply&n~
&c   The smells of fresh foods and cooking meats waft in from Brillo's establishment, only serving to whet the  
appetites of all who enter Redric's store. Unlike his cheery halfling companion, Redric's shop has little that
appeals to the eye, but some of the more exotic wines that are lined out for display do look like they'd 
complement a good meal. Large barrels fill most of the room, a great number of which are filled with water,
which is the primary source of the gargoyles income. There are, however, several barrels behind the counter 
various aged wines, which are expensive, but delightfully tasteful. Redric can be found here at all times of 
the day, often tasting samples to insure the quality of his product. He sits behind a counter, on top of which 
is a small &Psign&c for those who are unaccustomed to the working of his store.&n

  If you were to type 'buy waterskin', you would purchase the first waterskin listed in supply, the small 
  waterskin. Since this is not the item you wished, you could become rather upset. However, if you typed 
  'buy 2.waterskin', you would buy the second waterskin, which is the item you desired. Likewise, you could 
  purchase the barrel by entering either 'buy barrel', or 'buy 2.large' (the large waterskin would be the

&KElrin's Fine Jewelry&n~
&c  Rows of velvet covered boxes sit on display in glass cases. Lining each box are multitudes of jewels, jewelry,
and other trinkets of considerable worth. The lighting of the room is set to catch every sparkle of each jewel,
and each flash of brilliant gold. Elrin can be found here at all times of the day and night. As a darkling, he
needs little sleep, and no longer fears the daylight hours, and thus has chosen to run the shop himself at all
times. Even though Elrin is of the darkling race, he is a well liked, and very respected merchant in the city.
Any customer who enters his store can expect a fair price, whether it be buying or selling. A small &Psign&c sits
next to Elrin on a counter, inviting those unfamiliar with the purchasing practices of Brimstone to read it.&n

&gFor Those of you unfamiliar with the workings of my shop, I provide you with the following help:

If you wish to view the items I currently have for sale type - &GLIST&g
If you wish to purchase an item from the list, type - &GBUY <item>&g
&G*NOTE*&g - some items may have similar names. In this case you will need to view how many of
         item you want are similar, and purchase #.<item>. For example:
         The items I have in stock are: a pendant
                                        a glowing pendant
                                        a glowing ring
         If you want to purchase the 'a glowing pendant', you of course would not want to type
         buy pendant because you would purchase the first item 'a pendant.' By instead entering 
         buy 2.pendant, you will buy the desired item because the glowing pendant is the second 
         pendant item on the list.
If you wish to sell an item to me from your inventory, use the command - &GSELL <item>&g

If you have any further questions, please refer to your beginners handbook, or check with other 
players in the game. Thanks.&n

&KCorindel's Riding Supplies&n~
&c  Certainly one of the worst smelling shops around, thanks to the nearby stables, the riding supplies shop 
still does very good business. Various types of tack and harness line the walls, while numerous types of 
saddles sit upon racks in the center of the store. The owner of the establishment is a very large, very 
intimidating half-giant named Corindel. When mounts first became popular in the new world, much of the 
equipment was designed for the more 'normal' sized races. Since Corindel was such a great fan of riding, his
solution to the problem was to spend a number of years learning the trades of a merchant. His hard work has 
paid off, and when it came time to design the trade stores of Brimstone, the half-giants ideas were so 
intriguing to the council, he was given a business even though his scores were rather low. Though the store
specializes in larger sized equipment, tack for all sized races is proudly displayed for all to peruse. 
Corindel himself can be found here at all times of the day. Sitting beside him on his counter is a small &Psign&c
for those who may be unfamiliar with the workings of his shop.&n

&gFor those of you who are unaware of how my shop works, I provide you with the following information:

To see a list of the items I currently have, type &GLIST&g
To purchase an item from the list, type &GBUY <item>&g or &GBUY #.<item>&g

  For example, if you wished to purchase a hard leather saddle from the following list -
     a hard cloth saddle     - 400 gold
     a hard leather saddle   - 1600 gold
     a black leather saddle  - 3000 gold

  If you were to type 'buy hard', or 'buy saddle', you would purchase the first saddle listed in supply, the 
  hard cloth saddle. Since this is not the item you wished, you could become rather upset. However, if you 
  typed 'buy 2.hard', or 'buy 2.saddle', you would buy the second saddle, which is the item you desired. 
  Likewise, you could purchase the black leather saddle by entering either 'buy black', or 'buy 3.saddle'.
  It is all just a matter of recognizing like keywords in regards to the item you wish to purchase.

To sell an item from your inventory that I can use, type &GSELL <item>&g

If you need further assistance, please consult your beginners handbook, or check with others around you.

&c Many a brave adventurer with a desire to explore the world has spent at least some time testing
their skills and mettle within the proving grounds. &rShorn Phantomspell &chas used powerful illusion 
magics to create facsimiles of creatures one might run across out in the wilds. While they may only
be illusions, the magic is so strong that it tricks the mind into believing they are real. If you
are killed by a creature on these grounds, you will truly die and be returned to your starting
point and have to retrieve the items from your corpse. There is a small &Yplaque&c on the wall
