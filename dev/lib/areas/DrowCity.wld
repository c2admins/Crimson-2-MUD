&KEntrance to the &yMushroom Fields&n~
  The entire underground cavern is filled with fields of giant, luminescent mushrooms that not only serve as
as food source for the drow, but as a light source, and in some cases dwellings as well. Workers can be seen 
toiling in the fields at all times, the cracks of overseer whips hanging over their backs. The dim outline of
large structures can be seen at various points, but one would have to navigate the maze of pathways through the
mushrooms to reach them.

&KPath through the &yMushroom Fields&n~
  Upon closer inspection, not all of the mushrooms are luminescent. In fact, it appears that there are several 
different varieties, each of which serves a purpose. The smaller, non luminescent mushrooms, are harvested for
food, while the great, giant mushrooms are used for houses, cut up to make walls and basically used as building 
materials. The luminescent mushrooms come in all shapes and sizes, but their use is the same. They serve as a
light source for the cavern, and when harvested, to light the homes of the drow as well. It's even been rumored 
that some of these mushrooms give the drow armor and weapons the potent magic energies that make them so covet-
ed.

&KHouse of Lestel&n~
  Sitting quietly and almost unnoticed among the mushroom fields is the House of Lestel. The silver insignia
marks the undescript gates, and beyond can be seen the massive doors that have been built into the cavern 
walls. Several guards stand near the gate, barring passage from anyone without a house isignia or of lesser
status than the Lestel themselves.

the structure leads deep into the earth. It is not quite as grandiose as many of the other houses on the 
outside, but that is to the liking of its inhabitants.

usually be found just outside the massive doors, preventing anyone non-drow from entering.

  The most decorated of all the guildhalls, the members accepted into the clerics academy not
only receive the most attention, but become highly respected members of society as well. It is 
extremely rare for any male to be accepted, and those that are will usually serve Lolth in the 
form of driders before long.

&KEntryway&n~
  The cunning craftsmanship of the exterior gives way to the delicate artisty of the inner 
chambers that are House Lestel. A crystal chandelier adorned tastefully with glowing moss provides
a modicum of light, while the cold stone floor is polished an mirror-like, further enhancing the
light enough to accomodate non-drow who pass through here. A set of black marble stairs leads
into the heart of the living quarters, and judging by the activities in the rooms in the south, 
that is where the servants quraters lie.

Though the servants of House Lestel are treated more kindly than those of the other houses, the family must
maintain the typical drow image so as not to be discovered and overrun by a combined force of the other houses.

as a small cellar used for storing wines and more perishable products. A large iron stove dominates the eastern 
half of the kitchen, above which is a strange, yet practical umbrella-like contraption used for capturing the
smoke from the fire and filtering it out of the household. Among the foodstuffs laying around can be found many 
strange and exotic delicacies such as deep fried bat wings, pickled vampire toes and deep ox tails...yum.

walls and worn smooth by magic. The floor of the entire upper story is covered with a strange glowing moss that
not only provides comfort when walkign on the stone floor, but lights the entire area as well. Several 
tapestries hang from the walls, depicting legendary Lestel members performing amazing feats of one sort or 
another, while hanging from the ceiling at five foot intervals are crystal chandeliers of various colors to
provide a brighter look to the hall. The hall continues on to the south towards the family bedrooms, while a

carved chest sits at the foot of the bed, closed with an adamantium lock. A large mahogany desk sits next to a
small altar against the northern wall. Candles and papers clutter the desk, but nothing appears important. 
Against the southern wall lies a large vanity chest, in which can be found robes and other linen made for a 
priestess of Lolth. The same moss the covers the hallway also blankets this room as well, but otherwise there

and a desk, upon which can be found weapons of various sizes and functionality, all laid out for display. In

within this room though. In fact, she spends little time here at all if not sleeping, and can usually be found
within the kitchen helping the servants prepare meals.

&KKitchen&n~
  A large stove dominates the eastern wall, a large umbrella-like contraption used for capturing smoke and 
filtering it out of the household. A table covered with jars of spices and pickled foodstuffs lies against the
southern wall, next to it lies the doors to a cellar used for storing more perishable foods. Against the north-
ern wall is a cedar cabinet filled with row after row of dinnerware. The plates and silverware range from plain
porcelain to admantium laced with gold. They all look quite expensive, a true testemant to the power of this
household.

&KServants Quarters&n~
  Several cots line the room, but otherwise there is little of interest here. The servants of the drow, even 
though they are drow themselves, are treated like little more than slaves. They have few possessions and cert-
ainly nothing of value.

&KShort Hallway&n~
  Typical of all drow noble houses, the hallway contains several murals and draperies that depict scenes of
drow victory over varius foes. It is customary to depict ones ancestors in such a way to bring honor to the 
household and the more hero's a house has, the more powerful it usually becomes. To the east and west lie
archways that lead into small rooms, while to the north the hallway continues to a set of stairs. To the south
an archway leads into the main chamber.

&KUpper Chambers&n~
  The upper hall is undecorated as guests never come here. Several plain white tapestries hang from the walls,
their glow illumintaing the path before you. To the north is a door made of the purest mithril, while to the
south the hallway continues to a similar door made of adamantium.

&KTalryn's Room&n~
  This cozy little room is filled with old and dusty books of magic. Even the bed is covered in books, leaving

&KDeroune's Room&n~
  The most noticable thing upon entering this room is a large tank against the western wall that houses several
varieties of very venomous snakes. A small desk is next to the tank, upon which are several open vials as well
as satchels of herbs and a mortar and pestel. A large bookcase sits against the northern wall, next to a small
canopied bed covered with black sheets. The bookcase contains several books filled with various subjects ranging 
from political philosophy to how to win the heart of women.

&KTalice's Room&n~
  The floor of this room is covered with white carpeting that ends at the archway that is the only exit. A small
mahogany bed sits against the far eastern wall, covered with sheets of white silk. In fact, everything in this 
room is white, including the desk made of birch wood. Suprisingly there is no altar to Lolth in this room, nor
any items that would show Talice to be a priestess of Lolth at all.

&KGelroos' Room&n~
  Scars cover the white walls of this room where weapons have struck them in sparring sessions. Gelroos often
hones his skills here, and the rack of weapons in the southeastern corner of the room holds many of his favor-
ites. A large canopied bed covered with red sheets sits against the southern wall, but otherwise the room is 
bare.

&KGinafae's Room&n~
  The room of the high priestess is rather bare because she spends little time here. She spends most of her 
time in the great temple, seeing to the duties of the priestesses, so the only furnishings she has are a simple
bed and an altar to pray to the spider goddess.

with white tapestries as is the large canopied bed that dominates the western wall. A small altar to the spider
goddess lies against the eastern wall, a large desk bearing official papers and the like sits against the
southern wall. The first matron can usually be found here, organizing house events as well as organizing any
raids to the surface world.
