below.

It's getting warmer while you descent into the valley. The horrible sounds you 
heard earlier on seems to have vanished into thin air.

Surrounded by huge trees, it's impossible to see where the trail south is going.The shadows here are giving you an unpleasant feeling. You peer up to see if all
is safe now.

An open field.~
You are amazed what beauty can lie within so much horror. A small pond with
colorful flora and fauna lies in the middle of the field. A small river flowing from the east supplies the pond with its water.

with its water. It makes almost no sound, and the flora and fauna appear to be
a lot darker than at the pond.

You are face in face with a horrifying beast. There is only one escape, but that
appears to be locked. Looking at the beast, you notice a key in one of his claws. A saying comes up in your head... "Kill or be killed!"

north. Some kind of glow is coming from the ceiling... weird, but at least you
can see something now.

You are standing in a small hole, dug right next to the pond. It's covered with
mud and leaves and smells awful. Hundreds of little eyes stare at you from all
corners...

Center of the earth.~
You slide into a crack in the ground! Trying to get back, you wound your hands... with no result. You slide furter and futher towards the center of the earth. Time has no meaning to you anymore, and soon it will be the same with your life.
When you finally hit the lava you are somewhat releaved that you have stopped falling just before you incinerate into a cloud of gasses...
You are DEAD!
