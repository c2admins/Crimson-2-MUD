&KThe Gargoyle &WGatekeeper &Kis sitting on his pedestal...watching.&n
~
The gargoyle is made out of &kblack opal&B, just like the pedestal.  Its eyes burn &Rred
&Bwith a passion.  The gargoyle was put here by the deity of Utopia to stop anyone
from coming in.  It seems to be doing its job well based on the bloodied remains
strewn across the room.  The telepathic messages the gargoyle is sending you have not stopped
and you wonder what the signifigance of them is.

~
You examine a giant wyrm.  It has no legs but a very powerful back that it uses.  It's well protected
by its scales.  You doubt your sword could pierce those.  It has a fierce head full of razor sharp fangs.
You wonder if you can tame it somehow.

&wR&Ri&wn&Ra &Bwas a great healer while she was alive.  She did the citizens of Utopia a lot of
good.  She could also hold her own in battle and was not afraid to come to her homeland's
defense in times of need.  She died in one of these battles but was in reincarnated and put
here to serve her country eternally.

&SJ&So&Sl&Si&So &Bwas outcast from &YU&yt&Yo&yp&Yi&Ya &Bwhen he was young because he stole.
He gave himself a new name and wandered the realm establishing his reputation as
a mercenary and a soldier of fortune.  When &YU&yt&Yo&yp&Yi&Ya &Bwas in trouble however,
he came back and defended his land bravely.  After he died, the citizens recognized him
and he was resurrected.  He is surrounded in diamonds because of his extensive battles in
the Overlord's lair.  He accumulated great wealth there and when he died the craftsmen
built this tomb for him.

&GM&kercutio &Btwirls an ever-present blade as he slices, dices, and burns the critters.
He looks extremely dangerous and capable with that sword.  &GM&kercutio &Bwas &yU&Yt&yo&Yp&yi&Ya&y'&Ys 
&Bgreatest swordsman ever.  He could not get enough of battle.  He became so bloodthirsty 
and overconfident that it became his downfall.  He died fighting for the freedom of his land
outnumbered and surrounded, sure of his skills.  Although his pride is great, he has been resurrected
and placed here. &GM&kercutio is strong, muscular, and dexterous.  He wears no armor but you
have the feeling he doesn't really need it.

&WF&ca&Ww&ck&We&cs&n is in the middle of meditation.
~
Every warrior hopes that a great death will find him. But he couldn't wait;
he went looking for it.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of
the selfish, and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the 
name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley 
of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down on thee with great vengence
and furious anger, those who attempt to poison and destroy my 
brothers, and you will know my name is The Lord when I lay my vengence upon thee.

~
&BM&Ga&Bn&Gd&Ba&Gr is a gigantic human sitting here.  His eyes glow gold
as he sees you.  Unlike the rest of the guardians, he isn't dead.
His death was faked for his own protection.  He was being hunted 
by a god who he stole his golden yes from.  You can see he is a
capable warrior and the ages he has spent in these cramped
quarters have not diminished his skills.

&KT&r&Rr&Ka&ri&Rc&Kh&re&Rk&n is more of a monster than a man.  He is seven feet tall
and strongly built.  He looks like his might and fury is a match for anyone
but the pathetic man on the ground seems to be holding out.  This only
makes &KT&r&Rr&Ka&ri&Rc&Kh&re&Rk&n more mad as he looks to kill someone.  He wields a
blade &wsmoking &rb&R&rl&ro&Ro&rd&Ry &kexecution&n.  It looks like the hour of
death is upon you.

&BT&Ky&Bb&Ka&Bl&Kt&n is &KT&r&Rr&Ka&ri&Rc&Kh&re&Rk&n's right hand man.  He is a powerful
necromancer and is the real source of &KT&r&Rr&Ka&ri&Rc&Kh&re&Rk&n's army.  Whenever
there is a battle, &BT&Ky&Bb&Ka&Bl&Kt&n goes out into the fields and resurrects the
dead warriors.  As a result they obey only him.  &BT&Ky&Bb&Ka&Bl&Kt&n is a small man,
nothing at all like his master.  You shouldn't underestimate him, however.
He is a powerful student of dark magic.
