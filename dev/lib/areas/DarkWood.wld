what sort of a place this is. The smell of death is everywhere, there is a
tree with some strange inscription in it. Your knowledge tells you that you
are in the lands where orcs and Kiru live and breed.

This is the entrance to the Cave of Carnage. This cave was named after the god
Carnage for reasons that should be obvious. No creature of the sun has been h
here (alive) for many centuries now. You had previously thought that the tales
about the Cave of Carnage was only a legend or folk tale.

of bones everywhere. The smell of the place makes you nauseous and you have
an urge to get out of here now! From what you remember of this place, the god
Carnage was supposed to have built this cave himself so that his favorite 
creatures, the Kiru and Orcs, may live without interference from the outside
world.

that looks very old and weather worn next to a huge tree. The sign reads:
To all seeking the aid of the great magician Marius,
His greatness is currently busy working on a solution to end the corrupt
forces of Carnage from invading this forest once and for all.
It becomes quite obvious to you that the great magician must have failed in
his efforts to ward off the evil creatures of Carnage.

Wandering in the Old Forest.~
The large dark colored trees seem to move about as you move. You begin to w
feel uneasy about straying from the main path. You notice that the huge roots
coming out of the ground seem to have a life of it's own as well. The deeper
you get into the forest the most confused you become, trees move and block 
your way, or at least it seems that way.

The experiment room.~
This room is line with many strange looking objects. It looks like this must
be the place where the magician Marius experimented with his magic. the whole
room looks bent out of shape somehow and you feel as if you are going to lose 
your balance so you try to hold onto something but it disappears before your 
very eyes.

Lost in the Old Forest.~
You are standing in a maze of trees. There are willow trees that seem to move 
by themselves and the roots that stick out of the ground seem to be beckoning
you to come and have a nap under the trees. As you move from one room to
another the trees seem to move with you, causing you to lose any sense of
direction that you previously had.

The Room of Despair.~
You stand in a large empty room. It is painted black and has nothing but
sorrow to offer you. You start to feel very sad and depressed as you look
around this place. The emptiness seems to surround you and you start to
feel sorry for yourself. The only thing you can foresee of your future is the
death that awaits you.
