thing~
You bend down to see just exactly what this 'thing' is.  What you see is
an old mithril coin with the face of Loki on its head.  Only the denizens
of the dark would carry such a coin.  For some reason, you decide to 
leave the coin where it is.

Entrance to UnderMountain~
You stand at the mouth of a large cave.  Several camp fires have been
made and destroyed here.  A few scraps of bone and decayed meat lie in a
corner. You estimate the last time someone ventured into these caves
was just a couple days ago.  There is a hand-painting on the cave wall here.

picture nude female~
The picture is too sharp and clear to be a painting
it was obviously done
by some magic power.  The female depicted is not what you would call
pretty.

Food Warren~
The room you are in is lined with shelves loaded with all sorts of food.
Dead carcasses of giant rats hang from the ceiling.  A few roaches and
an odd assortment of bugs, scurry around on the floor.  You quickly make
up your mind that you do not like the food of duergar dwarves.

You are in a large room stocked with an assortment of magical contraptions
which glow, spark, and make soft buzzing sounds.  Wires and cables line
the walls and rafters of this room, often coming down, only to be connected
to several metal chairs.  Each chair contains a humanoid occupant, who in
turn, seems to be connect via wire and cable to the chair.  The occupant of
each chair seems to be near death or dead, you can't really tell which.

You stand within a lavishly decorated room.  An extremely large bed lies
in the center and you estimate it to be big enough for 6 regular-sized
humans. Stacks of incense burn in the far corner giving the room a 
smokey effect.  Giant decorative weapons hang on the walls.  Truly, this
room is large in all proportions.  A soft moan coming from under the
sheets on the bed warn you that you are not alone.
