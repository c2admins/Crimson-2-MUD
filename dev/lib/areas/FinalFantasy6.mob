mob Terra~
&PT&ye&Pr&yr&Pa&n~
&PT&ye&Pr&yr&Pa&n the &Whuman&n &resper&n stands before you.
~
A mysterious young woman born with the gift to use magic. Once 
controlled by the empire, she was said to have incinerated 100 soldiers 
in mere seconds.  Now siding with the returners she uses her magic to 
banish evil and fight the evil deranged Kefka.  Terra is an 
eighteen-year-old half human half esper with mint green hair, a red 
dress with a purple sash around her waist, red boots, red wristbands 
and purple shoulder-pads.  At first Terra is confused, fearful and 
amnesiac. She is suspicious of anyone who wants access to her powers 
and not fully knowing what those powers are adds to her wariness.  
Once she learns her true past and comes to control her powers, she 
turns her introspection to her humanity, a question that had troubled 
her from the start.  She worries she cannot feel love and asks others 
about their emotions to try and figure it out. This question becomes so 
overwhelming she briefly loses her ability to fight, but in the end Terra 
is courageous and resolves to fight and use her special abilities to make 
the world a better place.

Looming over you stands a giant 15 ft. ferocious yeti.  He has an
admiration of bone-carvings, and strength of a god.  He is the master 
of these mines, and is very unhappy to see intruders in his domain.  His 
fur is a silky white color and its neatness seems to indicate regular 
grooming.  Despite the ferocious nature of this beast, The Mog doesn't 
seem to fear him though in fact Umaro is rendered completely docile by 
the presence of the little moogle.

is bossy, uses loose speech and slang terms, and has the ability to 
control Umaro.  Although not the king of moogles, he should be.

Tritoch is discovered encased in ice by miners in Narshe. He looks 
like a large bird almost, and has the power to control the elements.  
The Gestahlian Empire finds out about its existence, and 
sends Terra, Biggs and Wedge to investigate. Narshe has proclaimed 
itself neutral in the ongoing conflict between the Empire and 
the Returners. In this case, they attempt to defend the esper against 
the Empire when they come to take it.  Tritoch defeats Biggs and 
Wedge, and communicates with Terra, releasing her from Imperial 
control. In a later meeting, he releases Terra's inner power causing 
her to transform into an esper and fly off.

&WKi&Cng&n &PEd&pgar&n sits on his throne
~
He is a master engineer, which leads him to create odd and unusual 
weapons, mostly as a hobby. Edgar often redecorates his room and is 
flirtatious with women.  He is the king of Figaro Castle and brother to 
Sabin. Ten years ago his parents were murdered and he became king at 
the age of 12.  He's cunning and acts as a double-agent for the 
Returners while pretending to be an Imperial ally. He advises the group 
on strategy and tactics and is daring, as seen in the chocobo-mounted 
escape from Figaro and castle dive.  He's committed to his 
responsibilities towards his subjects, protecting them as best he can and 
refusing to take items for free when shopkeepers offer.  Edgar wears 
light blue armor, with white boots, and a long, blue cape, all with yellow 
trim, to match the colors of the desert and sea. His eyes are a deep 
blue, a sign of Figaro nobility. His hair is in a long ponytail, kept together 
with two ribbons.

Arvis was one of the few residents of Narshe to take a side in the 
conflict. Narshe was a neutral town and most of the residents preferred 
that it stayed that way.  Arvis, however, knew that the Empire was 
going to attack Narshe anyway, for the miners who worked there had 
uncovered a frozen Esper.  Arvis was looking for a way to convince the 
Elder of Narshe to join the Returners, however this still did not convince 
the Elder.

all the singing at the opera.  However, Sabin usually doesn't mind jokes 
at his own expense and will laugh heartily at them himself. He has an 
unflappable determination and excels at thriving in situations where 
most ordinary people would die or give up.  Sabin wears white pants 
and a blue tank top belted with a sash, and like his brother, he has 
blond hair and blue eyes.

assassin.  He rarely talks and shows little interest in the exploits of 
others.  Shadow has a troubled past and even warns Terra about 
"people who have killed their emotions", and encourages her not to do 
the same.  Despite his cold and silent exterior, Shadow does develop a 
kinship with the party. Shadow wears black ninja attire with his hood up 
and dons a mask, hiding his facial features.  Could this man also be the 
father of Relm?

&RL&Wo&cc&Wk&re&n is here reminiscing about Rachel
~
A contact, spy, and saboteur for the Returners the resistance group to 
the Gestahlian Empire. He is driven to protect women he meets, 
instantly promising to help Terra and Celes despite them being former 
Imperial soldiers. His want to protect women is due to unresolved guilt 
over a past incident which he struggles with. This incident was a key 
reason he joined the Returners, and although he blames himself, he is 
angry at the Empire for their involvement.  Despite his tragic past, 
Locke is often less than serious. He jokes around with and about the 
other party members, particularly teasing Edgar for his flirtatiousness. 
He is proud of his skills and insistent on being called a "treasure hunter" 
or "adventurer" rather than a thief. He is kindhearted and tries to 
prevent others from experiencing the sorrow he has.  Locke stands 
about average height, with a wiry build. He wears a blue vest and 
trousers with a white shirt, He has light brown hair and wears a blue 
bandanna.

sanity as the process had not been perfected yet.  Kefka became a
cruel, destructive madman, and acquired a reputation as one of the
most dangerous men in the Gestahlian Empire.

Banon is a man of determination and spirit, leading a small rebel 
group against the might of the Empire. He has his agents fight with 
diplomacy, sabotage, and spying more than brute force. However, the 
harsh conditions of the war makes him somewhat harsh himself. He 
is very blunt when speaking to Terra for the first time and speaks of 
the atrocities she committed as an Imperial soldier, and brushes off 
Edgar's anger for not taking her amnesia into consideration. 
However, he does encourage her to join them by describing her as a 
ray of hope and doesn't intend to force her into it.

&KEm&rpor&Rer&n &RGes&Kthal&n sits comfotably on his throne
~
Gestahl's ambition is to project power over the world and use 
technology to make his Empire grow unparalleled in its military branch. 
Gestahl is ruthless in attaining his goals, shown in his forceful taking of 
espers and paying no mind to the experiments done to them. Not once 
did he show remorse regarding the ethical ambiguity of infusing 
children with magic or using a mind-controlling device.  Gestahl holds 
little regard for human and intelligent life, having his eyes set only on 
his dream Magic Empire. Even after Kefka's atrocities the Emperor does 
not punish him outside of throwing him into a prison cell. Gestahl's fake 
affability and attempt to trick and use the party to his own ends, after 
lying to them, shows his political knowledge. Gestahl attempts to stop 
Kefka's disturbance of the Warring Triad as his goal is to lead an Empire, 
and not to destroy the world, Gestahl has long white hair, a white beard 
and mustache. Being an emperor, Gestahl dresses in ornate robes and 
golden plates over red clothes lined with gold. He wears a black 
gold-lined head ornament that sustains a ruby.

happy and likeable person up front, but is still hurt by a great loss and 
distracts himself with gambling.  Setzer cannot resist a gamble, he 
thrives on risks, such as his planned abduction of Maria, and never 
passes up an opportunity to prove his skill.  Most of his scars come 
from gambling sessions gone wrong, although some also come from 
airship accidents.

mob General Leo~
&YG&ge&Yn&ge&Yr&ga&Yl&n &RL&Keo&n~
&YG&ge&Yn&ge&Yr&ga&Yl&n &RL&Keo&n stands tall with pride and dignity
~
Leo is a strong, upstanding, moral man with a strong sense of 
compassion and honor. The men of the Empire look up to him as an 
ideal example of a warrior and are proud to serve him. He is slow to 
waste human life on both sides of a battle, and is loyal to Emperor 
Gestahl. These qualities place him at sharp odds with Kefka, who has no 
regard for life or morality, and is utterly brutal in his tactics. Leo still 
treats Kefka with respect, but is aware of his behavior and warns him 
not to act rashly when Leo must leave the Siege of Doma in his hands. 
The one time he truly gets angry with Kefka is in Thamasa, where he 
attempts to threaten Kefka. It is unknown why a man like Leo would 
serve the Empire in conquering the world, but given he was born in 
Vector, it is likely out of a sense of duty and honor to his homeland.
