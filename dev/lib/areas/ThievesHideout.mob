mob abraham zealot~
&WAb&wr&ca&wh&Wam &KZ&Rea&Kl&Ro&Kt&n~
A shady looking thief is here, balancing a dagger on his thumb.
~
  Abraham, leader of this rowdy group of thieves plays the role of their leader. Though a number of would be
thugs would love to join his little gang, Zealot has created a strict and rather treacherous entrance exam
that scares off the weaklings, and ensures that his troupe stays in good shape.

mob jeremiah swanson~
&wJere&Wmiah &KSwanson&n~
A pious looking man strolls about, preaching words of wisdom.
~
  Jeremiah serves as the gangs spiritual healer. Though not technically a thief, the mental and physical well
being of his men prompted Abraham to enlist the services of a priest, and Swanson fit the bill. Though he 
doesn't condone the activities of the thieves, Jeremiah doesn't do anything about it either, and seems quite
content tending to the wounded and holding his sermons.

mob quentin rawe~
&KQuentin &wR&Kaw&we&n~
A tall man lurks in the shadows.
~
  When some of the shadier dealings need to be done, Quentin Rawe is the man to see. He, unlike the others of
this camp, is a true professional. He handles assassinations and many other the other larger monetary 
assignments, and with such has secured himself a high position within the band. For now he seems content with
his lieutenants role, but he could easily take the role of leadership from Abraham any time he desires.

A shifty ravshi thief is here.
~
There are no better thieves than ravshi thieves, so it's no suprise to see a number of them in this 
encampment. Used for many of the larger jobs, the ravshi seem to be doing better for themselves than 
several of the other factions, which may cause some discontent down the road.
