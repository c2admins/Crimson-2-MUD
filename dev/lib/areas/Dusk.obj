The new monster Vatang tears through the soft bodies of 
the small elven maids that served his wife.  Their pink
flesh proved to be no buffer to the sharp fangs or 
insatiable hunger of Vatang.  His wife enters the hall 
her maids frequent to only be horrified by the butchery.
In sheer terror she flees the room to what must have 
been her apparent suicide on the Bridge of sorrow.
