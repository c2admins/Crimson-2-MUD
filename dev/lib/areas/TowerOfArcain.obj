key note~
There is a riddle here to be told. It is of magical being and of hearts lost
a very long time ago. They are broken in two as if a great magical force split
them so they can never be joined again, but they can be. It is up to you to
figure out where they are and how to join them into one again.
                                              Good Luck,
                                                       Lord Arcain
