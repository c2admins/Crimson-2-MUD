mob pharoah ra~
&YRa&n~
the almighty GOD of the &Rs&yu&Rn&n, &YRa
~
&WRa was the god of the sun during dynastic Egypt; the name is thought to have 
meant "creative power", and as a proper name "Creator", similar to English 
Christian usage of the term "Creator" to signify the "almighty God." Very early 
in Egyptian history, Ra was identified with Horus, who as a hawk or falcon-
god represented the loftiness of the skies. Ra is represented either as a hawk-
headed man or as a hawk. In order to travel through the waters of Heaven and 
the Underworld, Ra was depicted as traveling in a boat. In dynastic Egypt, Ra's 
cult center was Annu. In Dynasty 5, the first king, Userkaf, was also Ra's high 
priest, and he added the term Sa-Ra to the titles of the pharaohs. Ra was father 
of Shu and Tefnut, grandfather of Nut and Geb, great-grandfather of Osiris, Set, 
Isis, and Nephthys, and great-great-grandfather to Horus.  In later periods Osiris 
and Isis superceded him in popularity, Ra, the great God, Lord of Heaven whether 
worshiped in his own right or, in later times, as one aspect of the Lord of the 
Universe, Amen-Ra.&n

mob anubis~
&rA&Rn&ru&Rb&ri&Rs&n~
the half-dog half-daemon &rA&Rn&ru&Rb&ri&Rs&n stands here.
~
&KAnubis was the son of Nephthys. By some traditions, the father was Set; 
by others, Osiris. (And by still other traditions his mother was Isis.) Anubis 
was depicted as a jackal, or as a jackal-headed man; in primitive times he 
was probably simply the jackal god.  Probably because of the jackal's 
tendency to prowl around tombs, he became associated with the dead, and 
by the Old Kingdom, Anubis was worshipped as the inventor of embalming, 
who had embalmed the dead Osiris, thus helping preserve him in order to live 
again. His task became to glorify and preserve all the dead. Anubis was also 
worshipped under the form Upuaut ("Opener of the Ways"),  sometimes with 
a rabbit's head, who conducted the souls of the dead to their judgement, and 
who monitored the Scales of Truth to protect the dead from the second death 
in the underworld.&n
