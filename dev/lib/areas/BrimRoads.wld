&yPersipus Highway&n~
&gThough mainly used as a trading route between the free city of &KBrimstone&g and its ally of &wSi&Klv&wer&WMoon&g,
the Persipus Highway is a main path of adventurers as well. To the west can be seen the Quel'Sith forest,
home to the wise and mysterious Quel'Sith elves. Few people have the opportunity to meet them, but there
are a number of rumors that open trading has been established between the elves, &KBrimstone&g and &wSi&Klv&wer&WMoon&g.
To the east is the city of &wSi&Klv&wer&WMoon&g itself, and beyond it lies the &BKandarian Ocean&g and further inland
are the plains of Locholme which connect to &yCragstone&g and the &YB&yu&Yrn&yi&Yng S&ya&Ynds&g.

&gOvergrown Path&n~
&g Though brush and vines make traversing the path difficult, it is obvious that this path has been used
often as of late. Just to the south lies the entrance to the forest of Quel'Sith, it's &yhuge tr&Gees&g standing
as a barrier between the plains of Locholme and the &BKandarian Ocean&g. Though it looks ominous, rumor states
that the elves actually protect beings that enter their territory.....just so long as those who enter don't
first harm the &Gf&yores&Gt&g or its inhabitants.&n
