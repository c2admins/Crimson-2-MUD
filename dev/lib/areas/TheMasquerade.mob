mob gaia mother garou~
&GG&ga&Gi&ga&c, Mother of the Garou&n~
Gaia lies in wait, preventing the kindred from leaving their sanctuary.
~
At the beginning of time, all was peaceful.  The Mother took shelter inside
the core of the planet, overjoyed with her creations.  But one day a deep
pain consumed her soul.  Angered and confused, she rose from her haven and
traveled to the surface once again...and upon reaching it, she found hordes
of her beloved slaughtered.  The day she had been dreading had come.

The arrival of the Wyrm on her lush planet had brought destruction to her
faithful minions.  Enraged, she hunted the kindred with ferocious vengeance
and destroyed all in her path.  After her annihilation of three great clans,
she trapped the remaining kindred within these walls.  She now stands here
for all eternity, guarding the entrance to the sanctuary to prevent the
escape of what lies within.

&BA monstrous vampire towers above you.  One of the largest of the antediluvians his mere size is enough to make you rethink your attack.  Looking closely however, you notice something is out of place.
He doesn't seem to have that strange aura antediluvians normally have, in fact, he almost seems weak.  It seems almost as though he has fallen prey to the hands of his kin.&n

Caine, father of the kindred~
The Sire of all Kindred looms over you.
~
Before you stands the father of the Wyrm.  It is his doing that these
creatures exist...he is the first, the trueblood, the immortal.  From
his progeny all Wyrm were spawned.

He stands before you, eyes closed, yet somehow you can tell he senses
your presence.  You suddently feel a sharp pain in the back of your
neck, and whirl around to find nothing there.

Before you turn back around, an immense pain fills your legs.  As they
twitch and spasm you topple to the ground.  This battle seems to have
ended before it even began, unless you can muster the strength...

You stare into the dark eyes of a shadow.  Whether he is truly
here or a figment of your imagination is indistinguishable.
When the ancients came, they brought forth the power of the
Daywalker, or the strength of the night.  This creature before
you is the only surviving Night Stalker.  His power is
unquestioned, but the light of day still pierces his soul.

Beware traveler - strike under the light of the sun, for darkness
brings only death.

As you gaze into his eyes, their icy glow penetrates your very being.  As you begin to retreat to debate the battle, those cold eyes seem to trap you.  Draw your blade, God save your soul.&n

You find yourself at the feet of Lucien, Antediluvian of the House of Lasombra.
~
The master of the House of Lasombra stands before you, emitting
a powerful aura.  A true Antediluvian, he was the first to enlist
in the great hunt.  He has been rewarded by his sire accordingly.

Many millenia of experience can be found in his hands, yet even
more importantly, the strength of the innumerable masses he has
slain rests in his soul.  Mad with joy at the chance of battle,
he strikes at you.

his sire that he gained the power he has now.  Yet, however
treacherous his means were, the outcome was desirable.

He now rules his minions with a peaceful hand.  His treaties
with the garou are the only that exist.  Regardless of the
meaning behind the treaty or even its purpose, it has served
well in making Siegfried one of the strongest in the land.

The lord of Clan Tremere, this Wyrm is a fearsome enemy.
As his is one of the original houses of the kindred, his
age is quite astonishing.  His advanced age certainly
does not work in your favor.

In his many years, he has learned methods of fighting
much stronger than those of the fist.  Beware the Wyrm,
for with him not even your thoughts are safe.

You have stumbled upon Arikel as he practices for his next battle.

You face the oldest of the Antediluvian.  As you become aware
of the wisdom in his eyes and the power in his arms, you grow
concerned for your own well-being.  With over five millenia
of power in his soul, and the strength of the fountain of life
in his body, he seems nearly invincible.

Caught in his gaze, you realize you must fight back before
it's too late.

Absimilliard the Fierce~
Absimilliard is here, hunting Caine in the name of Nosferatu.
~
An intense glow radiates from this being.  Within him is
the power of the Nosferatu and the strength of the
progeny of the Sire himself.  In his younger years he
was discontent with his position - to be an Antediluvian
was not enough.

After gaining control of the Nosferatu, he diablerized his
brother-in-arms, gaining the ancestral power of the progeny.
With his new-found generation his power grew without end,
as did his lust for more.  When he finally reached the
pinnacle of his strength, he was overcome by madness.  Now
he hunts Caine, day and night, in search of a power he shall
never have and could never hope to control.
