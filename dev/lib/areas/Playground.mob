&KYou have entered into what has become a nightmare straight from &Rhell&K.  This beast appears to have escaped from one of the many gates it has surrounding it.  Its large mass consumes what you thought to be your great skill.  It's claws larger than any sword you could possibly wield, it's body bigger than any monster you have ever encountered.  It stands towering over you, fangs dripping fresh blood and flesh from some unlucky bastard who decided to try to slay the beast.  You're the next in line.&n

&wThe person who was to become St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, was born in Wales about AD 385. His given name was Maewyn, and he almost didn't get the job of bishop of Ireland because he lacked the required scholarship. Far from being a saint, until he was 16, he considered himself a pagan. At that age, he was sold into slavery by a group of Irish marauders that raided his village. During his captivity, he became closer to God. He escaped from slavery after six years and went to Gaul where he studied in the monastery under St. Germain, bishop of Auxerre for a period of twelve years. During his training he became aware that his calling was to convert the pagans to Christianity.&n
