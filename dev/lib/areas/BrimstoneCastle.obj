preface~
    We shall begin where all good stories begin..at the beginning. Before the realm as we know it
was formed, when evil reigned and the light of goodness that now exists was hidden in remote 
corners of the world with little hope of being saved. This story is about ten brave souls, outcast
from their respective societies and shunned by all they met. Even in these dark times, these indiv-
iduals were able to find each other, trust in each other, and feed off one anothers strengths to do
what had never been done before....fight back against the evil. Their story is one of mystery, of
glory, of tragedy, and even times comedy, but most important of all, it is true...a real life story
of Legends. And so, let us begin......
~
E
chapter1~
  I first met Vorn Ul'Azzr while taking s troll through the Quel'Sith Forest. I had always heard
stories of the mysterious protector of those woods, but I had never expected to meet him since he
only seemed to appear when evil was near his domain. But there he was, right in front of me. A tall
lithe figure obviously not human, though just as tall. He wore simple forest garb with no evidence
of any armorings underneath. A bow as black as night was slung over his shoulder, and a blade 
sheathed in a scabbard lay on each hip. he looked, simply, like an ordinary ranger out for a patrol
of his territory. He didn't appear to be the destructive force I had heard whispered in the 
rumours, but there was one feature about him that caught my attention and mesmerized me. It was his 
face..or lack thereof. Where his chisled features should have been, instead was an inky blackness 
that not only peaked my curiousity, but frightened me as well. As I stood entranced by this globe
of darkness that hid his features, he spoke, a calm, soothing voice that was both soothing melodic
to my ears. he asked, simply, what I found so curious about him. I blushed, having forgotten the
ranger ability to sense emotions in other beings, including animals. I replied with a question, 
asking him why he hid his features from the world. A soft chuckle was the only reply I received, 
and he wuickly turned to leave. I swear i only took my eyes off of him for a second as I reached 
for my writing scrolls, but in that time he had disappeared as if swallowed by the forest itself.
I wandered the rest of the day befuddled by my meeting with the being simply known at that time as 
'the Guardian' it wasn't until my next meeting with him that I understood his true nature and the 
reasoning for hiding his face, but that you shall llearn about later, for now you must meet the
second of those who called themselves 'The Circle of Fate.'

story~
  it was an cold winter night on the 14th day of the month of Crystal Rain, year 265. Vorn was
on his way to his tree shelter, having just bagged a meal of venison for himself and his adopted 
daughter. Save for the howling wind, the night was quiet, as was typical this time of the year in
these lands. The birds had long migrated to warmer climates, and many of the larger mammals were
nestled deep within their burrows hibernating the winter away. It had snowed most of the day, and
were not the drow elf an excellent tracker he would have trouble navigating his way through the 
barren forest thanks to the fresh snow that now laid upon the ground. Near his tree house Vorn
suddenly stopped. The perfect layer of snow before him had been disturbed. From what he was able
to determine, there were over a dozen sets of tracks. Several of these were animal, wolf from the
looks of them, but like no wolf the elf had ever encountered. The wolf prints were huge, larger
(most were) than his hand, but several other sets were slightly smaller. This probably meant a 
fair sized wolf pack had crossed recently, the larger tracks belonging to the alpha male and 
female. There were other tracks also, however...human. They numbered about half dozen or so 
judging from the various sizes, and they had crossed this path more recently than the wolves. It 
suddenly became apparent to the drow that these humans must be poachers looking for a few pelts
to sell on the market. He certainly couldn't allow himself to be called a ranger and let poachers
hunt upon his protected territory so he set about tracking down the scoundrels. 
  It wasn't long before he found the firs corpse. It was a large, greyish-white wolf about the
size of a normal dire wolf. It had been stabbed with a piercing weapon numerous times, ruining
the pelt. These men were not poachers after all, but were killign for the sheer pleasure of it.
Vorn flushed for a moment, becoming completely enraged buy such a waste of life. His rage was only

the teeth of the wolf were not fully developed...the wolf was but a cub. Now as much curious as
he was angry, Vorn once again set off tracking down the despicable humans. he found several more
bodies along the path he was following. Most were more cubs, five more in number. Their colors
ranging from a pure white, to greyish-black. There were two human bodies however, and Vorn smiled
with satisfaction that these human beasts would never again slay an innocent animal.  It was then
that he heard a yelp of pain. the drow broke towards the sound, silently casting a spell to 
levitate his feet above the ground for greater speed. He could only hope he was not too late. The
number of wolf tracks had grown few, meaning there weren't many left. He pulled up short after
rounding a tree and seeing torchlights. There, in a defensive stance stood the largest wolf the 
elf had ever laid eyes upon. It was a monster, being nearly six feet tal at the shoulder and a 
hefty twelve or so feet in length. his coat was a pitch black which only accented his perfectly
white teeth which were bared to the group of humans that stood before him. The creatures back

story2~
was to an equally large pure white wolf. She looked to be mortally wounded as crimson blood 
covered her once beautiful coat as she lay in the snow barely able to move. As Vorn stood staring 
at the wolf, his eyes met hers for a moment....the pain, the fear, the anguish in her intelligent
eyes was more than he could take. These were not ordinary wolves, they were sentient creatures 
like himself. before he even realized it, he had lept over the white wolf to join her mate, both
Fyrebrand and Shadowslayer drawn and ready. The black wolf never even flinched, almost as if it 
recognized Vorn's assistance for what it was. The humans at first were taken aback by the presence
of the elf, but soon gathered themselves. They still numbered five, and they should easily take
out a spindly lookign elf and a wolf. The last thing Vorn remembered before entering his Dance was
Fyrebrand pulsing in his right hand. it could smell the evil around him, and it wanted a taste of
its blood............

aftermath~
  Vorn paused a moment, forcing the lust to kill to be buried deep within his soul once again. 
Fyrebrand no longer pulsed in his hand, it had been satiated long ago and was covered in blood. He
turned to look for the black wolf. It was a short ways to his right, staring at him with what
appeared to be a relieved look in his eyes. 
  Fuly under his own control again, Vorn turned his attentions to the white wolf. As he approached
her, he could hear the black wolf growl lowly, but was quickly silenced as the white wolf shot a
glance back at her mate. She had lost alot of blood. The most dangerous wound was in her chest, 
where part of a spear shaft still remained. He stood over her, examing the wound. It was deep, but
from what he knew of wolf anatomy, no vital organs appeared to have been punctured. he grabbed the
shaft of the weapon, half expecting the she-wolf to lunge at him to protect herself, but she lay 
still as if trusting the elf. He quickly pulled the weapon from the wolfs body. She yelped in pain
but again lay still, waiting to see what the young drow would do next. Luckily Vorn always carried
a pouch og healing herb with him on hunts should he ever be injured. he smeared the concoction 
over the white wolfs wounds, and then applied a few bandages that were soaked in medication. She 
would live, but she would be in pain for awhile. it was then that the most shocking event of the 
evening happened. A voice, strong and masculine entered his mind. It was not spoken aloud, but was
more akin to a telepathic link. He turned to the black wolf, a look of shock upon his face. 
Completely flustered, he stared into the male wolfs eyes and managed to stammer, 'Your welcome' 
before once again turning to finish bandaging the white wolf.

story~
  The group they required to invade the Underworld was almost complete. They still lacked a 
stealthy thief. Balinor had dabbled in thievery, but he was mainly a warrior, and dwarves weren't
very suited for scouting missions where silence was key. They also required a backup healer. Though
Magick's skills were highly advanced for her age, the large battles they were about to engage in 
would be moe than her powers could handle. Telsek had heard rumours of a witch who lived within the
Teldescian Swamps. Not a suprising place for a witch really, the inhospitable nature of the swamps
was sure to keep away any witchunters. Unfortunately, the swamp was also inhabited by a dark mage
by the name of Caliban. many stories had spread throughout the region of the dark experiments he
performed upon the inhabitants of the swamp, but knowing no other alternatives, the group set out
to find this witch that had eluded the magician all this time. 
  The trip through the Quel'Sith forest was uneventful as usual. This was Vorn's territory, and any
beast that was not his ally would dare not attack him. It wasn't long before they found themselves 
on the borders of the Teldescian Swamp, it's dark gloomy interior was a sharp contrast to the 
beautiful setting of the Quel'Sith. the muddy waters of the swamp meant for difficult travel, but
the ranger had ventured a few times into the swamp and knew a couple semi-dry rails they could use 
to get them closer to their goal. The travelers had only been walking a few hours before the sun 
began to set. With the trails that Vorn was familiar with behind them, the party decided to set up
camp rather than risk running into some peril of the swamp like quicksand. Aerion decided to take 
the first watch. The usually talkative mage had been uncharacteristically quiet the morose the past
few days, but the others didn't argue as they quickly built a fire and laid out their sleeping 
rolls. As usual, Vorn didn't stick around camp long before venturing off somewhere into darkness.

it was apparent to the others that this annoyed both Magick and her sister Sylvania, but he had 
gotten them this far so neither argued his solitary treks. 
  Aerion's shift passed without incident, so Balinor decided to take the second shift as the others 
prepared for bed. Vorn had still not returned, but this was not unusual. The drow would spend hours
off on his own, never speaking of his activities upon his return. 
  A deafening roar shook the through the night. The group of adventurers lept from their beds, 
trying to shake off the effects of their sleep as Balinor let out a shout of suprise from his post.
Now fully awake, and weapons in hand, the party began scanning the outskirts of their camp for the
'thing' that had woken them. The troll had an advantage over his friends. besides the drow, he was
the only one in the group who could see in the dark as well as a human could see in the day. Vorn
was still nowhere to be seen, and it was obvious from the look in Magick's eyes that she was more
than a little annoyed. The elves and dwarf looked at each other in confusion, their infravision 
unable to find any heat signatures in the surrounding area other than small mammals. They, along 
with the humans turned to Telsek questioningly, trying to find some answer to what danger lurked 
just out of reach in the shadows. At first the huge troll saw nothing. The swamp was quiet and 
still. Then he saw it. A shadow at first, hard to make out in the dark murky waters, but then it 
grew and became more defined. The others stared at the troll as a look of horror twisted his face.
"Dragon!" he screamed just as the creatures head began to break the surface of the waters. The  
quickly formed a defensive line. it was too late to flee now, the dragon was practically upon them
and was much more suited to traversing the swamps then they were. The beast was huge, measuring at
least fifty feet in length. It's scales glistened in the moonlight, large black scales. "This isn't

good." Telsek thought to himself. "These lizards breath acid that can eat through the strongest 
armours." Nevertheless, the group stood ready to defend themselves. Telsek, Balinor and T'alsril 
the lizardman warrior were the front line. They were the toughest warriors and had the most 
protective armor for withstanding the dragons attacks. Sylvania and Magick stood begind them. The
silver haired sister was the backup warrior shoudl anyone fall, and magick was there to heal or 
fight as needed. Aerion and Shael rounded out the group. Shael was a gnomish elementalist mage. His
spells woudl provide extra protection for the party, while Aerion's offensive spells would would 
be a great aid in battle. The dragon roared in anger. Black dragons were evil and malicious to 
begin with, but this ones territory had been invaded and it was in no mood to talk. A glob of 
spittle fell from the beasts mouth and began burning a hole through the log it fell upon. Each 
party member winced at the thought of what affect the dragons attack woudl have on flesh and bone.
T'alsril struck first. He was the most impatient of all the group, and with a mighty war cry lofted
(scratch lofted) charged at the dragon, swinging his mighty battle spear in a deadly arch towards
the dragons throat. With a sickening thud the blade of the spear struck on of the dragons 
neckplates. Seemingly satisfied, the lizardman withdrew his weapon from the dragons neck and stood
horrified at the fact that he had barely scratched the thick plate. The dragon seemed almost amused
at the pathetic attack, and took a moment to pause before inhaling deeply. the beast was about to
release his dreaded breath attack and T'alsril was still to stunned to avoid it. The demise of the
lizardman looked iminent when suddenly a large globe of darkness appeared of teh dragons head. 
The dragon howled in rage, shaking it's head to and fro in an attempt to shake the magical globe.

story~
Now effectively blinded, the dragon let loose it's mighty breath, but only managed to dissolve a
nearby tree. The group scrambled for cover. The dragon could no longer see them, but they could 
get crushed in the thrashing rampage of the enraged dragon. Sylvania's elven ears picked up a low 
whistle over the cries of the dragon, followed by a loud thud. The dragon roared in agony, raising 
its head high into the air before once again renewing its attempts to shake the globe of darkness 
that was consuming it. A second whistle was heard, followed by another thud and roar of pain. This 
time the dragon collapsed. It was still alive, but but gravely wounded. A third whistle came from
over their heads, and this time a roar did not follow the thud. Everyone sat breathless, waiting 
for signs of life from the dragon, but none came. The globe of darkness dissipated from the 
creatures head, and there protruding from the creatures face were three arrows. The first two were 
lodged in the creatures mouth andcreatures head, and there protruding from the creatures face were three arrows. The first two were

and covered with runes. Only one person in the swamp carried arrows like that and could shoot with 
such accuracy in total darkness. Each party member slowly turned, already knowing the figure that 
would be standing behind them. Vorn was there, bow still in hand, accepting their accusing 
glances. He chuckled lightly and said aloud, 'Well, it's better that I was late than to have not
been here at all."
   The rest of the night was uneventful, but the group didn't sleep much. Vorn took the remainder
of the shifts as punishment for his disappearance. He was used to being awake for days at a time 
from his patrols in the Quel'Sith, so he accepted the task with no complaint. The party broke camp
at dawn, only pausing to relieve the dead dragon of some scales and teeth which could be useful
later to a smith. Balinor, always the treasure seeker suggested searching the dragons lair for
some valuables.
