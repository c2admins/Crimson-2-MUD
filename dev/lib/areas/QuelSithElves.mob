  Tinewen is the exception to every rule. Unlike the other female elves of Quel'Sith, she bears tattoos not
unlike the men, but more of them. her dark brown hair is tied into a pony tail, and her face is painted with
designs that give her a feral look. She stays away from the other elves, preferring instead the company of
the Kil'Ron Mor wolves that she tends. The only person she has ever been known to socialize with is the 
mysterious "guardian" of the Quel'Sith forest, most likely because they share a similar bind with the wolves.

mob male kil'ron mor wolf black~
&yA &Kblack &yKil'Ron Mor&n~
&yA &Kblack&y Kil'Ron Mor watches you from a distance.&n
~
     Rumors say that the Kil'Ron Mor were created when an ordinary wolf took
shelter inside the fabled Elven Tree of Life on a cold winter night. The magic
of the tree granted that wolf increased intelligence and size in exchange for
the protection of the elves. Whether this story is actually true or not is un-
known, but the Elves of the Quel'Sith and the strange wolves do share a bond 
that has lasted for generations. Once a bond is created, one would gladly die
to save the other in any battle.
     The magnificent beast before you stands nearly six feet tall at the 
shoulder. Jet black fur accents sharp green eyes that stare at you with a pro-
found intellect not found in normal beasts. In every other respect, the Kil'Ron
Mor looks like a normal wolf.
