Giggle's room~
Accelerator's scream from tires that streak.
Cupe, with your women on, dashed out.
Run away from the shadows, shut the door.
You said, "I don't care where, just run.
Encounter is a highway junction by the time I saw the harbor
I now know that I'm in love.
Take me to summer side, you said you prefered gentleness than a kiss
Night on summer side, with an innocent look in your eye, of an adult.
Take me to summer side, you said,"I prefer a kiss to loneliness"
Night on summer side, And the way you looked it was of an adult.

Temple Hallway~
   You have ventured further into the Shaolin temple.  The monks are more
numerous, and the great flaming altar is directly north of here.  A small
hallway leads off into the darkness to the west.  Loud chants of worship
come from the north.

Before the Altar~
   There are numerous monks here.  A high priest is blessing all who ventures
to the north.  Only a small handful of people dare venture into the flame
that is north.  Pictures of ancient battles adorn the walls.  A small hall
exits to the east.  The crowd is going back to Main Street, obviously,
they are not pure of heart.

The Altar~
   The altar of Buddha is surrounded by fighting monks of the Shaolin temple.
There are hundreds of people kneeling down before the altar.  You notice a
large wooden statue of Buddha standing here.  The eyes give off a strange
ambience.  In a loud voice, the statue bellows, "Infidel!"  The monks start
attacking.

oblivion.

they have to eat tofu to get their protein.  A large table is in the center
of the room.  Otherwise, the room seems to be deserted.  It must not be
