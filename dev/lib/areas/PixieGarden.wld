Indigenous Gardens~
You wander aimlessly through plants indigenous to the area.  The limbs of many
trees dangle into the path, not allowing you to see too far ahead.  The bushes
and leaves all around you buzz with activity and energy, some occupied with
more than the wind.

Fungus Cellar~
The contrast from the light levels above to the darkness here blinds you for a
moment.  As your eyes begin to adjust, you see what you have already felt.  The
humidity down here makes sweat pour down your face and gives life to the
thousands of mushrooms growing from piles of feces on tables all around the 
room.  The only things more stifling than the humidity and the stench are the
glares of the mushrooms themselves as you let the light of day in to 
disturb their peace with the darkness.

in trellises down each of the sides without exits.  There is a ladder leading up
to the top of the gazebo before you and you can see the shaded path to the 
indigenous gardens to the west, a statue-lined promenade to the east, and
a path down to the fountain to the south.

with your eyes from the large, ornate fountain as far as the edge where it
narrows into a river and goes down roughly fifty feet in a waterfall.  This
is the resting place of Cuka, the guardian of these gardens.  She protects
them at all times, assuring no picking of the flowers or walking the paths
after hours.

You walk out along the promenade to enjoy the artwork of the great pixies of the
period.  The graceful sculptures line the path, dappled with sunshine in the
pattern of the leaves lightly interwoven overhead.  All exhibit the same natural
grace, but some let you see the physical power or mental power of an individual
pixie hero.  Each has its own character and a definite place in the scheme of
these elegant gardens.  The path continues to the east and leads into the gazebo

shattered shell still down there through the mist?

are uncountable flower beds terraced gradually down to meet the lake.  Any

ingredients or hallucinogens to make you happy for days.
