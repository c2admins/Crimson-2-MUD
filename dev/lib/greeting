CRIMSON II

Zoning port
Ask the zoning council for ideas about zones.

This port is for zoning.  If you log on, it should be to work on your
zone.  If you have a character on this port higher than your normal
character, please remember that this port is not a place for you to hang
about and play with commands you don't normally have.

WARNING:  Do NOT mess with vehicles unless you have been told how to use
them and do not use this port as an opportunity to get yourself a fun kit.
