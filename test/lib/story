	It is a time of great change in the lands of Midgard. The high priests
bowing to the will of the Lords of the Land refused to offer the proper
sacrifices to the GODS on the last Celestial Conjunction. In a rage the Gods
have turned their anger towards the town and towards the people of that town.
	Places that were once easy to get to have suddenly vanished. Creatures
that were but legends have suddenly arisen again and are terrorizing the
country side. What are the people to do.
	The king has sent out an urgent summons to all the heros of the land.

	"My friends:

	My kingdom and people are in terrible times. Without the favour of the
	GODS we will surely die. Heros are needed at once to take up the 
	quest of re-establishing the bounderies of our lands and reclaiming
	those areas that the monsters have taken from us.

	For your country and me, please answer our call.

			King Talos of Midgard"

	And so it stands. The world is not as it once was and the safty that
was once commonplace has been torn away. If you are brave enough, enter. If not
may the GODS forgive you.
