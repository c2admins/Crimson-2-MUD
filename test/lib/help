AUCTION
Auctions on crimson mud 2 are for selling and buying of equipment.
Please use this for those purposes only.  
&BAuction is not a means of identification of objects.  For that
you need to buy scrolls or use the spell of identify.&n  

&RCaution: Anyone can buy anything from an auction.  If you put
something up for auction or a mob does it.  Do not cry to the
immortal staff about this.  This is part of the game.&n

IMMORTAL_ABUSE

Immortal abuse will result in review of immortal status, and could result 
in the loss of immortal standing, login ability (ie, siteban), or the 
removal of players (if situation involves use of immortal for mortal multi
benefit).

Immortal abuse can include, but is NOT limited to, the following:

Casting spells (locate has NO excuse being used by immortals without some
form of announcement beforehand - There may be instances where using locate
may be useful or productive in problem solving or handling mortal affairs.
However, immortals have more useful tools in handling these scenarios) can
result in abuse consideration.

Transferring / summoning players without permission in UNNECESSARY 
situations.  If a legitmate purpose is being served (immortal intervention
for arguments, dealing with rules infractions, being asked for a transfer 
to talk, etc.), there is no area for abuse.  Transferring people to 
unwanted locations, or transferring in a manner creating a nuisance are 
situations where abuse can be claimed.

Loading equipment for personal mortal / avatar use.  Loading gear for 
serious playing nature for personal players of ANY level is abuse.  Novelty
equipment, such as eq with no stats (or negligible stats), is not abuse.  
Any eq that may aid game play OR influence the playing environment (eq 
loaded to sell / trade would be an example) should not be loaded for 
personal use.

When in doubt, ASK.  If it seems wrong, don't do it.  If it's questionable,
don't do it til you can consult with a &Y*BOSS*&n.

#
ADJUST

syntax: adjust <spell #> <Character Name> <New Duration>

This commands allows an immortal to adjust the duration of a spell that is
currently affecting a character.  There is a limit to the number of ticks 
you can adjust the spells up to, but keep in mind that some spells should
never be set to that limit. (In fact most shouldn't.) Use common sense and
good judgement when adjust spell durations, and please do not abuse the 
command.  If it is found that this command is being abused more 
restrictions may have to be implemented.

See also "IMM_RULES" "IMM_RULES2" "IMMORTAL_ABUSE"  

#
DISABLE

syntax:  disable <command>
         disable spell <spell #>

This command will disable a command or spell.  It requires the mud to be
rebooted in order to be effective.

Note:  This is a ADMIN command.

#
BOUNTY

 PK players may place bounties on other PK players at the Bounty Master located
west of the Questmaster.  The minimum bounty is 100 million coins, with the 
maximum set to 1 billion coins. 

SYNTAX: bounty <name> <amount>

 Also note that the Bounty Master will take his cut of 25%, so when you place a
bounty of 100 million coins on someones head, you'll actually pay 125 million
coins (100 million + 25%). If you try to place a bounty on someone who already
has a bounty, the money you pay is added to his/her current bounty total, up to
the maximum of 1 billion coins. 

 When you kill a player with a bounty on his/her head, the head falls from the
victims body and drops into your inventory. When this occurs, there is a 50% 
chance that the victims head equipment will come with it. The equipment becomes
property of the killing player, and can be removed from the head via the normal
means of collecting items from corpses. However, should the killing player fail
to remove the equipment prior to returning the head to the Bounty Master, the
equipment will be auctioned and is fair game for anyone to bid on.

 To collect the bounty on someone you killed, simply drop the head at the  
Bounty Master.

 If you find a bounty on your head, you may remove it at a 25% markup:

SYNTAX: bounty payoff

To see a list of bounties, from anywhere, use bounty list:

SYNTAX: bounty list

*IMPORTANT* -- Only PK players may place and collect bounties. The only 
            exception to this is when a mob places a bounty on a players
            head. When this happens, anyone, PK or not may collect the 
            bounty as per the methods above. 

            *NOTE* Only players above level 34 can have bounties placed on
                   them by mobs, and when this occurs, there is no chance
                   of losing headgear.

#
PKSTEALING

Stealing from other players in PK is not allowed.  Do not do it.  That 
is all.

#

IQR

IQR - Imm Quest Rules (Avatar Quests)

Quest Rules:
1) Must have 5 avatars, 3 of which are in different clans (prevents
   favoritism)
2) Items used must be 3% or higher, and not max.  Some times, with proper 
   approval, the 3% can be removed, and 2% or a 1% can be allowed.  (See 
   a &P*GOD*&n)
3) No more than 2 pieces of eq should be used in a quest, per participant.
   Thus, if you have 5 participants, do not use more than 10 pieces.   
4) If a no_rent item is already loaded in the game, it can't be loaded anymore, 
   qeq wise (prevents repetitive items).  
5) Immortals who run the quests must pay attention to events happening in their
   quests.  It is not the responsibility of all immortals to take care of quests
   that they did not load.  If you start a quest, finish it.
6) There are some times when the rules can be put to the shelf, but only 
   with proper approval.  Approval may ONLY be obtained from a person with a
   *GOD* flag.

DARKLING

Suggested levels: 20-40.         Align: Varies.

Start off by heading west through the woods next to Midgaard.  Eventually 
you'll turn south, walking in this direction until you hit the foothills of
Haon-Dor forest.  Then turn again towards the west to enter the land of the
darklings.  

#
REIMB_LYING

Lying during a reimbursement is lying, period.  Whether you asked for an 
item, or merely kept the item due to an immortal mistake, you are claiming 
a piece of equipment that is not yours.

Lying during reimbursements is VERY serious.  Lying to immortals is an 
offense, and lying about equipment for your own gain and taking ADVANTAGE 
of immortals who are trying to help you regain your equipment has very dire 
consequences.

Offenses include any matters related to reimbursements.  Asking for 
equipment you did not have, keeping equipment that was erroneously given 
to you, or AIDING people in reimbursement lying / cheating.  NOTE: Aiding 
an offense is just as serious as committing it.  You knowingly and willingly
engaged in deception.

The consequences are as follows:

1st offense:	Kit purge on the guilty character(s) and a week of jail.
2nd offense:	Deletion of guilty character(s).
3rd offense:	Deletion of all known multies and siteban.

For an immortal to pursue a reimb_lying judgment, however, the immortal 
must give the offender a chance to return the improper gear BEFORE pursuit.
This means that an imm may ask, "Are you sure that those pieces are all 
yours?" Or the imm may ask, "Are all those items the correct ones, no 
additions?" All they are required to do is verify the equipment with you.

#
EQ_RECALLS EQUIP_RECALLING

Due to some issues with equipment errors (due in part to the occasional 
glitch or poor equipment checks), we are instituting a new "recall" policy.
Immortals have the right to confiscate items that are incorrect (an item 
missing minlevel flags, or items that are terribly unbalanced, etc.).  

This will NOT apply to "oldgen" equipment.  If the eq was INTENTIONALLY one
way and you legitimately earned the eq with stats that you were MEANT to 
have, immortals may not strip you of this gear.  If glitched eq or 
unbalanced eq is discovered, the eq will be confiscated AND REPLACED with 
the correct item.

This means you'll still have the item with the stats that the item was meant
to be popped or is allowed to be used.  For example, due to some weird 
glitch, you pop a serrated short sword that is 9d8 pierce.  This item is NOT
to be kept.  It follows the same basic policy of bugs.  We will trade you 
the correct serrated short sword. 

If the recalled item had extreme stats and the replacement is of obvious 
difference, the immortals MAY compensate you further with quest equipment, 
gold, a bless, etc.  The type of compensation, and whether you get one, is 
up to the imm.  You may NOT try to negotiate the compensation.

This policy goes into effect IMMEDIATELY.  If immortals approach you, please
comply.  We are striving to provide equal pieces (if not equal chances) for
the populace.

#
KILL_THEFT KILL_STEALING MOB_THEFT MOB_STEALING

Kill / Mob theft would be described as someone stealing the mob 
that you are currently fighting.  You must be fighting the mob 
or healing up and getting ready to go back to the mob for it to 
be considered theft.  You can not claim more than one mob at a 
time.  Hitting a mob and then running off to another zone due 
to your item popping, does not reserve that mob for you.

You may not monopolize mobs for yourself.  If you are not 
currently attempting to kill that mob, or healing yourself to 
do battle with that mob again, you may not claim it as solely
yours.

A good practice would be to see if the mobile is in excellent 
condition.  If it is not, find out who was attacking it, and if 
they are no longer fighting it.  Healing a mob to excellent 
condition does not give you the right to kill it.  If the mob's
status seems questionable to you, just ask if someone killing 
it currently.

- First offense for this act is a warning by an immortal and the
  compensation of coin and any eq popped from the stolen kill.
  This means you give the coins that you received from the mob 
  and any equipment gained from the mob to the player whom the 
  kill was stolen from.

- Second offense for this act is the same as the first offense, 
  plus two days in jail.

- Third offense will result in the purging of the thief's kit 
  and a week in jail.

- Subsequent offenses will be dealt with on a per case basis,
  by the immortal handling the issue.

#
POP_THEFT

If a mob loads equipment, whoever killed it last gets the eq IF 
they stayed on to watch for the POP.  Logging on, killing a mob 
and then logging off does not give you rights to claim the eq 
if the mob pops.

Does this mean the mob belongs to you even if it doesn't pop? 
Of course not, this was covered in KILL_THEFT.  If the mob pops 
and someone else attacks it and promises to deliver the eq to 
the rightful owner, will that be okay?  Only if both parties 
consent to this course of action.

If someone pops a piece of eq and someone else gets the eq and 
returns it to the rightful owner, does the person who 'stole' 
the kill YET gave the eq away to the proper owner get the next 
pop?  Yep, they were the last person to kill the mob.

Remember the following however:
You may only claim ONE mob at a time.
You may only claim ONE pop at a time.
See the referenced help files for more details.

#
POP_THEFT2

Pop theft has limited protection, and has aspects which are illegal.  Due to 
variable scenarios and possibilities, this file serves to outline the limits
of pop stealing (legal vs. illegal).

Following the tenets of mob stealing (a player may only claim one mob at a 
time, if they've attacked the mobs), the same holds true for pops.  If a 
player attacks a mob with the intent of popping a particular item, and that
item pops, they legally popped the item.  However, they may not run a series
of mobs and claim any and all items that pop UNLESS there are no other 
claims to that pop.  They can only claim one pop at a time.  If they are 
running a series of mobs and only one item pops, it's the original player's
pop.  If more than one item pops, you can only claim one.

Example:

Twinkie has been running the same four mobs for two hours.  No one else has
been killing those mobs, and two of the items on the mobs pop.  Twinkie is 
obviously faced with a decision on which pop he wants FIRST.  If he kills 
one mob and gets the pop, the pop is his.  The second pop, if no other 
claims are made, is also his if he kills the second mob.  However, if 
someone else claims the second pop while Twinkie is engaged on the first 
pop, Twinkie has no dominant claim to the item.  Of course, Twinkie does 
have the ability to inform and ask that the second pop go to him, but there
is nothing enforcing his right to the second pop.

SEE ALSO: POP_THEFT POP_THEFT3 MOB_THEFT

#
POP_THEFT3

If a player logs off, or logs off to log on a different player, the claim 
to any items previously is lost.  Only the original player involved in a 
popping run has any claim to a pop.

Example:

Twinkie decides for some reason to log off the Twinkie character and log on
a multi, Raisin.  After logging on as Raisin, he notices that one of the 
mobs he was running happened to pop and others are now running that mob.  
Due to logging off and in essence being a different player, Twinkie/Raisin 
has lost claim to that pop.

If a player is engaged in a run and is the rightful owner of a pop and pop 
theft occurs, the pop must be returned to the original player.  Due to the 
focus involved in claiming rights, those who violate legitimage popping 
claims face penalties ranging from jailing to kit purging IF the pop is not
returned to the rightful player.

ZONELORD

Zonelords are people who are creating new zones for the mud. They have
been granted special privileges in their respective area(s) to enable them
to do this. On the rest of the mud they are normal characters with regularly
earned mortal or immortal levels.

If you want to contribute toward CrimsonMud, the best and most common way is
to create a zone.  To create a zone you should have an active or committed
player for Crimson 2.  You do not necessarily need an avatar character.  The
zones are granted based on presentation and interest.  You need a reasonably
original idea, that fits in with the rest of the mud... Futuristic or 
modern-day zones are not accepted.

Once you have decided what you aim to do with a zone, mail the details to
Oldschool contact them via mudmail so that your proposal can be considered.

Before you will be given a blank zone to work with, you must have a clear 
idea of what you aim to achieve.  It is perfectly acceptable to alter things
as you go along, but you should not start from scratch with no idea of what 
you are going to do.

Also (except for special cases), your zone should fit within 100 rooms, 100
mobs it is rare for a zone to use more than about 30) and 100 objects 
(again it is rare for a zone to need even close to 100).

Once you have had an idea accepted, you will be given a blank zone on the
zoning port to work with, and instructions on how to use the online creation
facilities.

&RRestrictions:
The zonelord and his/her other multies are not to use equipment from the 
zone even if someone else goes to the zone to get it, during the first  
week the zone is live.  The zonelord is not allowed to tell others about
the zone.  Do not give guided tours or tell others (mortal or immortal)
about any items, mobs, rooms, etc.

Note, the zones designed here effectively become the property of the mud.  
We will of course give you copies of your files if you wish them, to do 
with as you please, however we reserve the right to keep the zone on this
mud, even if you should decide to leave.  You may ask to have your zones
removed, but under no circumstances do zoners have the right to remove zones 
unilaterally.  Crimson 2 bosses will make that decision.&n

PUFF

enough, she may entertain you. ;)

#
BOTS

Bots are illegal here on Crimson 2. This has been changed for the benefit
of all players. We believe that botting is a disruption to characters who
are actively playing the game. It also goes against the spirit of the game.
Botting will not be tolerated on the game. First offense will result in 
jail time decided by the Imm staff one at the time. This will not exceed the
punishment for higher offenses, Second offense will be a week of jail, and
the  Third offense will result in being permanently banned from the game.

#
MOB_AUCTION "MOB AUCTIONS"

From time to time mobs will steal and auction an item from a
player it just killed.  Why?  To help recycle the equipment 
that is currently in play.  Any active player who is playing 
at the time may place a bid on these items.

Immortals have the right to interfere with these auctions as 
they see fit.  Some reasons for interference might include 
but are not limited to: auction caused by a loss to a quest 
mob, to deal with bids made by players who are not actively 
playing at the time [ie. bots, inactive visiting players, 
etc.], or to just be a good samaritan.  Immortals have the 
choice to interfere or not, but they should not at any time 
be expected to step in on anyone's behalf.
  
#
Harassment

Harassment is not taken lightly by Crimson II.  If someone is being
sexually harassing, it is an automatic day in jail for first offense,
a week for second and any subsequent offenses will be dealt with on a per
case basis.

Any other harassing actions will result in a warning from an Immortal.
If such actions do not cease, a day in jail will be given for first
offense.  Second offense will give you a week in jail and any subsequent
offenses will be dealt with on a per case basis.

Harassment is not limited to public channels, it could be actions or
done over private channels.  If you are caught, you will be punished.

AUCTION BID
    This help is only temporary.

Syntax: Auction <object> <Min_bid> <Min_raise> <Min_level> <Max_level>
        Bid     <coins>

Where <object>    is the item you want to put up for auction.
      <Min_bid>   is the minimum price you want to sell it for.
      <Min_raise> is the minimum amount of coins they have to
                  raise the current bid with.
      <Min_level> is the min level the bidder can be, defaults
                  to 1 if nothing is put.
      <Max_level> is the max level the bidder can be, defaults
                  to 100 if nothing is put.

      <coins>     is the amount of coins you bid for the item.

If you don't supply a <min_bid> or <min_raise>, 0 will be assumed
for these values. For big values you can use points.
Like 150000000 can also be written as 150.000.000

If you don't supply a <coins> for 'bid' then the lowest possible
value will be used (so last bid + raise).

When you type 'auction' without any values a screen will show you
all the information on the current item being auctioned (if any).

#
DEX
    Dexterity encompasses a number of physical attributes including
hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, precistion, balance, and

the above attributes, while a low dexterity might well indicate that
one of these attributes is superior, but that the others are very poor.

#
CHA

with a very high charisma.

    By default you can have LEVEL/10 mobs following, with a max
	    of 10 total followers.

BONUS_CHA - This affects the number of followers you can have, and may help
            reduce attacks from aggressive mobs when in a group

from the high priest.

    1) additional move points per level are calculated as follows:
        GAIN = (DEX + (CON / 5) + (LEVEL / 5)) / 3.5

#

"SAVING THROWS" SAVING_THROWS
Saving Throws are measures of a character's resistance to special types of
attacks such as poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or
mind of the character.  The chance to save is based on the character's
level and class.  The lower your saving throw, the better.  Saving Throws
are classified into five categories of priority:
    1) Paralyzation, Poison, or Death Magic
    2) Rod, Staff, or Wand
    3) Petrification or Polymorph
    4) Breath Weapon
    5) Spell.

Example:
    BattleAxe is struck by the ray of a Wand of Paralyzation.  A save vs.
wands and a save vs. paralyzation would both be appropriate.  However,
since save vs. paralyzation is a higher priorty than save vs. wand,
BattleAxe must save vs. paralyzation.

#
TOUGHER SCALES 62
    Tougher scales should be thought of as a tougher set of skin.  
    Throughout the world of crimson only the toughest warriors can
    survive some of the onslaught brough to them by the most powerful
    of creatures.  With tougher scales the damage you receive will be
    lessened by your thick skin.
   
    Reduces damage taken by (skill*dex)/100 per hit.

throughout the event.

If any character goes to the highpriest and types HEAL they will get a god

it. (although, you can be summoned out of it if you don't toggle nosummon)

At the end of the Hellnight time limit, the regular mud mode of this mud is
put back into play. Whoever has the most Player Kills in the syslog file is
the winner.

Graphics
set graphics new/set graphics old

Graphics affect your display of certain things on the mud.
most note-worthy are the practice command and the set flag display_dia on.
They can change your old display to a base setting from which you choose.
Examples are:
set graphics new
set graphics old

See Also: Diagnose, Lines.

#
Lines
Number of lines to currently be displayed.

Lines affect your ability to see how many lines on your screen at once.
this is mainly for things like posts, practice command, etc...

Examples: set lines 20

#
ALIGN
Alignment ranges from evil to good (-1000 to 1000) Generally on this mud
you will find it more easy to become evil and more hard to become good.

#
DONATE
Kindess helps other newer players out.  Sometimes you can get too much
stuff that you do not use.  So donating them to the midgaard donation
room is a nice choice for some.  You may choose to use this for old
worn out items.  &RDO NOT SELL OR AUCTION ANYTHING YOU FIND IN THE
DONATION ROOM!&n

See Also: Jail

example: donate sword

#
REPLY
Reply can be used to reply to someone who sends you a tell.  If the person
who tells to you is invisible, you can still reply to them but you will
not be able to see who it is.

#
REPORT
To report your hits, mana, and moves to those in the room with you, simply
type report!

#
GT

private channel meant only for the ears of anyone in that group.

usage: gt <string>

#
BECHO
This command gechoes an info line that is blue (for those who have color)
and should only be used if you really want to grab everyone's attention!
See Also:  GECHO

#
PERSONAL
This flag on an object makes the player unable to drop, donate, or give
the item and makes it impossible for an item to be stolen.

#
ECHO
This is an immortal command which allows the player to 'echo' a string into
the room they are currently located. It's usage is echo <string>. eg; echo
Grant is cool, would send the string Grant is cool to everybody in the
room.

IMMORTALS can use gecho which will send the string to everyone in the game.

#
SPEEDWALK
Speedwalk is a handy little string of directions one can enter to run
rather quickly through a few rooms.  It helps when avoiding dangerous 
creatures and also saves from having to hit enter everytime you want
to move a few rooms.

Usage is : speed <dir><dir>
Speedwalk is speedwalking through areas. Example : speed ddwnn

#
SET
Set allows a character to set/uset their flags.
    Example: set flag <flag> <ON of OFF>
    For a list of all flags, enter: set flag
    Immortals can set a start room with : set start <room number>

#
ANSI

Entering ansi will turn on colors.  If your terminal program supports
colors you will then be able to see the mud through a bright new world
full of bright and dazzling colors.

Entering color will give you a list of the existing colors in whatever
color your terminal program is actually showing them so that you either
know what you are missing out on or can work out fixing them!

See also:  COLORS

#
QUEST_FLAG
Usage:  SET FLAG QUEST <ON or OFF>
Toggles a quest flag for special questing purposes.
Such as defending Midgaard or being on a quest.
Be careful though, as certain quest mobs will target you if you 
THE GODS WILL BE UNHAPPY WITH PLAYERS WHO TOGGLE QUEST WHEN NOT ON A QUEST!

See also: QUEST

#
ASSIST
Syntax:  ASSIST or AUTO ASSIST
By entering either of these, you will toggle your assist flag on and off.
When it is toggled on you will help group members immediately when they
attack.  When it is toggled off you will not jump in to assist
automatically in a battle.

#
WIMPY
Syntax:  WIMPY or AUTO FLEE
For those who play cautiously the wimpy function will allow you to flee
when below a certain amount of health.  This is not considered cowardly
just merely smarter to run and live then stay and die.  Only the hardest
core player will run with this function off.  Caution: You will not be
able to flee while raging.

#
NOSUMMON
Syntax:  SET FLAG NOSUMMON <ON or OFF>
This toggles your ability to be summoned on or off.  With this flag on, it
is more difficult for others to summon you.

#
REIMBURSE

    The IMMORTALS can reimburse players.  Reimbursements are only given
for a crash within the mud or a mud problem. If your server crashes
and you lose everything we are sorry but we can not help you.  If you
lose link and autorent doesn't save your kit, we are sorry and can't help
you.  Please don't ask because we hate saying no. If you ask we'll still
say no, its that we hate saying it.
   If the mud doesn't crash and you lose an item or two, we will assume
you lost it to player or mob stealing or have accidentally junked them.
If you really must be assured, we will double check what happened to the
item, but 99.9% of the time it is one of those reason.  If the mud crashes,
it is highly unlikely that you will lose only an item or two and therefore
only entire kits will be reimbursed, not a few items (best to type save
after you get new items etc).  If you can show there is a bug in the
program and the mud is dumping your item unfairly, we will reimburse and
fix the problem.  If you have lost an item that was changed as a quest
prize we are sorry, but quest mods are not tracked.  If you lose an item
from hellnight mod, you will receive the basic item in your reimbursement,
and your used pts will be returned since we keep records of them.

    We will only reimburse equipment. Not coins, exp, or quest pts!

REIMBURSE_POLICY "REIMBURSE POLICY"

Reimbs are to be done at one time.  Reimbs cannot be started at one time
and finished later.  They have one shot at them.  Before you begin a reimb,
make sure they have composed a list. It will save you time because you
won't have to wait for them to think about what they had, and it gives them
a better chance of getting a more complete reimb (more likelihood that they
will remember by writing it down).

Reimbable items include: weapons and equipment.  &RQuestpoints, gold,
scrolls, potions and experience are not reimbable.

Multiples of a weapon are not to be reimbed.  If someone says, "I had 3
stings," they get only one sting.  Weapons are too easy to lie about
on reimb in multiple form.&n

Reimbs are allowed in these circumstances:

1) Crashes or reboots where whole kits are lost.

In the event an imm cannot confirm you had a container in a room, you must
wait for someone who can before the container may be reimbursed.  This is
the only exception to the "one shot" rule above.

The container will not be reimbursed if someone in your clan or anyone
takes the eq off of the ground, you are still putting it there at your own
risk, and at your own levels of trust.

2) If immheld quests cause a loss of kit, you are eligible for reimb.  If a
mob elsewheres you into a dt and you lose the kit, or a quest mob junks
your corpse, it is the responsibility of imms to reimb.  No one should lose
kits when imms are trying to perk up game play.  This is to the descretion
of the immortal in charge of the quest, if they so choose their quest can
be non-reimburseable, this is only if they say before the quest though,
otherwise it should be.

Reimbs are to be given by immortals if the immortal feels that one is
deserved.  &RNo one is ENTITLED to a reimb.  If imms are feeling benevolent
and wish to help, they may.  No one has the right to demand one.&n

&BReimbs may be done by any IMMORTALS.&n

SEE ALSO: REIMB_LYING

#
FORCE
This allows you to force a mob or player to execute a command. The usage is
force <target> <command>. eg, force orc bounce would cause the mob, orc, to
bounce around.
Use of this command is allowed for 'humorous' purposes, but care must be
taken not to endanger players if using it for these reasons.

Also, if you are using it for humorous purposes and the target person
asks you to stop, please exercise some sense and do so.
You cannot force a character higher level then yourself.

#
REBOOT
        The mud is rebooted when new code is installed or when the
    computer is shutdown and restarted.  You'll see a message to the
    left of your prompt with REBOOT_n_MIN.  Where n is a the number
    of minutes before reboot.  The REBOOT_n_MIN prompt appears during
    the last 30 minutes before a reboot.  A message is also sent at 30,
    20, 10, 5, and 1 minute(s).

        As you have plenty of warning, we ask that you avoid getting
    killed just before a reboot.  If you don't get back to your corpse
    before reboot, you'll lose all your items and we would feel bad
    about that because the donate room will be empty and you'll have
    to kill gnome guards and start rebuilding a kit.

        Usually a reboot is less than 1 minute.   If its going to be
    longer, you'll receive plenty of warning.

        Date/Times are based on Central European time.

See Also: HALT SHUTDOWN TIME BACKUP

#
SHUTDOWN HALT
        These commands are for terminating the mud, and should be used
    with caution.  To shutdown the system immediately, enter:
           SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE

    To schedule a shutdown at a later time, enter:
           SHUTDOWN n
    where n is a number from 5 to ?? in minutes.   The system will
    automatically count down the minutes and reboot the system.  Users
    will see the following on their prompt line: REBOOT_n_MIN.  A
    message is sent at 30, 20, 10, 5, and 1 minute(s).

    To cancel an automatic shutdown, enter:
           SHUTDOWN 0

See Also: REBOOT

#
TRANSFER
This command will move a mob or character from wherever it is in the mud to
where the player is at that time. It's usage is transfer <player/mob>.
You cannot transfer a character higher then yourself.

#
GOTO
Avatars and immortals may use this command to move around the mud directly
from one place to another. The target of the goto may be any player, mob or
room number. When this command is used by an avatar, it costs a certain
amount of hits, moves, and mana. 4% of your Max hp/mana/move. Levels 42+
have unlimited usage of this command.

See also: POOFIN POOFOUT

#
VNUM
With this command, immortals may find the number the computer uses to
identify objects/monsters, usually for the purpose of using the 'load'
command afterwards. The usage is vnum (obj/mob) <keyword>,
eg; vnum obj cotton would return the line:
    [Virt#] curr.   perc Object Name
    [14123]    50     15 obj cotton overalls

where [14123] is the object's number, 50 is the number currently in the
game, 15 is the chance percent of the obj resetting,  and obj cotton
overalls are the keywords the item can be called by.

See also: LOAD

#
POOFIN POOFOUT
    These allow players of level 41 and above to define the messages
    shown to other players when the character uses GOTO to enter a room,
    instead of using the default arrival messages.
             Usage poofin/out <string>.
    eg, poofin drops from the sky, by the character Bird would be seen
        as:
            Bird drops from the sky.
        instead of just Bird appears in a puff of smoke.

    NOTE: You can use $n to position your name.

See also:  GOTO

#
BAN UNBAN
When a site has proved to be a constant source of troublesome players, the
entire site may be banned from accessing the mud using ban.
Ban may be used with the arguments all or new. All will ban the site
entirely, whilst new will allow existing players access, but stop any new
characters being created from that site.

The usage is ban <argument> <sitename> <reason>.
eg, ban all whitehouse.gov I felt like it.

Unban <sitename> can be used to remove this ban.

#
AT
Immortals may use this command in conjunction with another command, to
'redirect' the other command to the location specified by the 'at'
command. Usage: at <location/mob/character> <command>
eg, at bird smile bird, would smile at the character Bird, wherever in the
game Bird happened to be, not just if he was in the same room.
The most common use would be at 3000 trans Bird which would transfer Bird
to room 3000.

#
SWITCH RETURN

Mortal Usage of Switch : switch victim>

As a mortal skill, this allows the player to redirect their attack upon
another player or mob in the room in the middle of a fight.

Immortal Usage of Switch/Return:

Using this command, immortals may take control of the body of a mob and use
it as if he were playing that mob. The mob will respond as if that is the
imm's actual self. When the player wants to return to his own body, the
return command is used.
Whilst using this command, imms should bear in mind the rules on helping
mortals, and attacking mortals.

See also: IMM_RULES

#
INVIS
This command allows an immortal to set their visibility value. The command
is invis <No> eg. invis 15 would make an immortal invisible to all chars
under level 15. Higher level gods can thus hide from players and lower
level gods. Vis setting is shown at the left side of your stat bar.
When you are interacting with mortals please be visable to them.

#
SCAN
Scan allows a char to scan for mobs in a dir or it may be used by itself.
Ex: scan <dir> or scan
Immorts can scan <No> <dir> where <No> is the number of rooms to scan.

#
SNOOP
    This command is aimed primarily as an aid to investigating when
players are abusing each other using tells, or other such behaviour,
which cannot be confirmed by other means. Usage is snoop <target>, and
the imm will see everything the mortal see's and types in, preceeded by
a %. When snoop is no longer required, it may be halted by 'snooping'
yourself, ie snoop <your name>.
    This command can be easily abused, and players must ensure they do
not do so. Any infringments of this will be stricly dealt with.

    For everybody's clarification. Snoop is intended for use in watching
people who you think may be rule breaking mainly.  It can also be used
from time to time for one or two other reasons, HOWEVER, it is not
acceptable and will be viewed as an abuse of power if you are snooping
simply to eavesdrop on somebody's conversation.  Also if you do snoop
somebody and then have to step in and tell them something, you are NOT
to be invisible when dealing with the player.

If you are snooping legitimately and overhear something personal, you
are not to act on it, and CERTAINLY not to comment, or anything like
that.  Snoop is for business only.

See also: IMM_RULES

#
CRASH
    Despite our best efforts, sometimes something goes wrong and the
mud crashes.   This means the program stops executing and you see:

        Connection closed by foreign host.

    Crashes are not intentional and we'll do our best to get it fixed.

See also: SAVE  REIMBURSE

#
NOHASSLE
   When on, aggressive mobs won't attack you.

#
SNOWBALL
This is a special social command available to immortals.

See also: SOCIALS
#
ILLEGAL

There are various things in Crimson Mud 2 that are illegal.  When trying 
to determine whether an action is illegal or not, you should generally use
common sense.  

A short list:
Abusing public channels.
Summong a player to an aggressive mob.
Kill stealing mobs.
Summoning wombles to steal player corpses.

Generally something will be referred to as illegal in a help file for that
specific thing.  If you don't see anything about whether an action is 
illegal or not, if it is detrimental to the enjoyment of the game for others
assume that it is illegal and do not proceed.

Ultimately any illegal acts will be handled by immortals as they see fit.
Legality and illegality is determined by the immortals, and is not subject
to discussion by the players.  Violation of any rule, engaging in any 
illegal act, will be punished.  No exceptions.

#
PKILLABLE

To pkill, you must have your PK flag set.  With this flag on, you may kill
others with the flag.  Everyone who has the flag set on has a red <PK>
beside of their name in the who list. This flag can be set in the login 
menu.  If you kill someone with the flag on, you will not be able to turn 
it off for 24 hours.

Pkilling still has some constraints, outlined in PKILLING and PERSECUTION.

See also:  PKILLING PERSECUTION

#
PKILLING
Last updated 6/13/03

On Crimson II we allow players to Pkill other players.  To enter
into the pkilling aspect of the game, you have a few options.  One
is to set your PK flag.  You can also venture into various arenas
throughout the mud and play against other players.  You can also engage
in clan wars.

Due to some players persecuting players they don't like, we have
established some rules which still must be followed.

  - Immortals/Gods may not kill players.
  - Avatars can kill Avatars. If you do this preferably be away from a
    mort.
  - Avatars may kill morts, and vice versa. Avatars are expected to show
    maturity in this respect.  You may NOT kill anyone 10 levels in
    difference (greater or lesser) from you.
  - A player MAY NOT be killed if they do not have the pkillable flag
    (identifiable by the <PK> by their title in the who list), or if they
    are not in an arena environment.  If you have a problem, contact a god.
    There is coding that SHOULD protect pc's without the pkillable flag. 
    Any form of manipulation of a pc by any means to cause them death is
    illegal unless both players have the <PK> flag.
  - If someone is provoking you into assaulting them to make you look like
    your persecuting, tell a  god char to snoop the offending player or
    yourself.  If the god see's it he/she will take care of it.
  - If you want to summon someone and pkill them, YOU summon them.
    Summoning a player to be killed by someone else is illegal.  Do not
    use your avatar to summon a mort, even if you are using a mort to kill
    the summoned mortal.
  - &RLooting a players corpse is no longer legal.  If you find a way around
    the code.  You will be punish most harshly.&n 
  - &RDo not pkill players in rooms flagged DUMP. This is considered the
    same as looting!&n

Generally, just use common sense when you pkill someone. Don't persecute
them.  Kill them once and drop the grudge.

An arena 1 down from the Market Square has been installed.  Anybody can
pkill or be pkilled here, regardless of what flags they have.


Note: If you happen to make someone mortally wounded and you leave it that
      way do not try to steal equipment from them.  This is no longer
      allowed.

SEE ALSO: PERSECUTION

#
PERSECUTION
We have had problems with player persecution... We define persecution rather
laxly on Crimson.  If you are Pkilling a char every time they log in with 
your mort or multi's we are generally going to call that persecution. If a 
character comes to us and complains that you are multiple killing them, we 
are going to call that persecution too. (If we find out that is true).
Players DO NOT have a "right to Pkill" anyone they want when they want to.
Pkilling is GENERALLY done out of fun here.  It is a showing of strength in
the world of crimson.  If a player asks you to stop, you should grant them
that same courtesy.  
If someone accuses you of persecuting them,  we will figure out the 
situation.  The Immortal will decide your fate based upon what the
circumstances are and make a reasonable decision.  You may attempt to appeal
that immortal's judgement.

Example:

  Bird kills Robin during a session.   Robin logs back on, Bird kills Robin
  again.  This happens several more times.  Robin screams persecution.  
  Morgan, an Immortal, pulls both Bird and Robin aside and asks why.  It is
  found that Robin has been TAUNTING Bird repeatedly.  Morgan decides to let
  both characters go.  And tells Robin to stop irritating Bird.  If she does
  it again she will be jailed.  If Bird Pkills her again he will be jailed.

  - Pkilling someone with a multi will count toward your total pkilling 
    score.  (ie I kill someone with my char Death, then the same character 
    with my char Stalker, I will have pkilled that character twice and be 
    subject to persecution enforcement.)
  - If an Immortal asks you if someone is your multi you MUST tell them.
    Ignoring them will only get you into BIG trouble.  They may take certain
    steps to insure that the char is your multi.

*  Do NOT think to persecute one and all on Crimson 2.  If your goal is   *
*  malicious abuse of others, find another place to play.  If you show    *

RULES_1 RULES

See help RULES_2 and RULES_3 as well.
We the Administrators here at CrimsonMud II want everyone to have a good
time and get everything possible out of their Mud experience.

The immortal structure on this mud is as follows:

The Wiztitles on 'who' are:
---------------------------
Level
  &c48        &C[-----IMM-----]  &cIMMORTALS&n.
  &P50        &p[-----GOD-----]  &PADMIN&n.

All immortals are equals, but each have specific functions associated 
with their respective titles.  Generally most queries would be directed 
at a &CIMMORTALS&n.  If you are unable to find the respective immortal
at the time, you may address your concerns with any other immortal that 
you can find.

You MUST listen to the Immortals/Gods. If they tell you something LISTEN
to them.  If you do not agree with the decision you MAY appeal to an ADMIN.
However, you'll find that in most cases if the decree is reasonable, it
will be enforced.  The word of a ADMIN is law and if your appeal is denied,
accept the decision.

All Immortals are to be treated with respect.  Each rule has some room for
error within it and the Immortals must interpret them.  The Immortals of
Crimson II volunteer their time and effort to make the place more fun and
interesting for everyone.  Should you be found unable to treat the Imm
staff with the respect they are due, you will find yourself in jail to 
reconsider.

See also:  IMMORTAL
#
RULES_2

See help RULES and RULES_3 as well.

If something seems like it might be stretching the rules...dont do it, even
if it is not expressly stated in the rules that it is 'illegal'.  If people
are not constantly 'stretching the rules' we can focus on other things to 
make the Mud a better place.  Treat these rules as a guideline and we will 
all be ok.

* Player Killing IS legal on Crimson for more information on this enter:
      HELP PKILLING.

* Stealing from players is not legal at Crimson mud. (See help PKILLABLE)

* Summoning agressive mobs to places where they might kill anyone but you is
  illegal. (try to imagine how you would feel after a 5 hour marathon which
  raised your character to the pinnacle of 10th level, only to be killed 
  just outside the inn by Gargath, Lord of Tarterus....). This includes 
  summoning a player to somewhere they may be killed by mob or pkiller 
  (unless the summoner IS the pkiller).

- First Offense:  A day of jail.
- Second Offense: Jail for a Week.
- Third Offense:  A month in jail.

* Stealing other players 'kills' is illegal.  If another player is
  fighting a mob DON'T kill the mob.  Also if someone is in a room with a
  mob ask if it's their mob before killing it.

* Selling of characters, or giving of characters is illegal.  Any offense 
  is punishable by deletion of the character involved, the highest multis 
  of the people involved, and possible deletion of any imm multis of the 
  parties involved.

#
RULES_3

(see RULES_1 and RULES_2 as well)
* Donation room eq is just that.  Donated equipment.  If it's in there then
  anyone can come in and do WHATEVER they want with it.  The ONLY exception 
  is a corpse.  Some people will donate corpses so that you get them back 
  without running to the site you died in.  If this happens you may NOT 
  take items off the corpse.  HOWEVER, donator's do this at your own risk.
  If the corpse decays, and the equipment is on the ground, then the 
  equipment is classified as DONATED equipment.  Which means if your corpse
  is in there and decays and a newbie walks in and picks up your Sword of 
  Glory or Chaos Rings... tough luck!  Beg with them, plead with them, 
  realize that it is perfectly in the rules for them to keep the equipment.
  (So usually harrassing them isn't a wise idea)
  Other limitations are that you may NOT sell/junk/or auction donated eq.

- First Offense:  Warning by an Immortal, made to give back cash and eq 
                  gained this way.
- Second Offense: Purging of kit, 1 week in jail, gold set to 0.
- Third Offense:  Purging of kit, One month in jail, all gold set to 0.

NOTE:  A disrespectful attitude will get you nowhere.  If you can't
       treat an Imm with respect, you may be left in jail to cool
       down.  All of these rules have room for interpretation.  The
       Immortal(s) on-line will make an initial ruling.  If for some
       reason you do not think that your judgment was fair, seek an
       IMMORTAL to look over your case.  The IMMORTAL will pass a
       judgement and this judgement may not be appealed to any other
       immortal.  In truly severe cases (and ONLY truly severe cases)
       one of the bosses may choose to pass his judgement on a situation.
       The listed penalties are only guidelines, but should be adhered to.

Once again we are trying to make this Mud a fun place to be for everyone.
If we all try to get along as much as possible and respect each others
right to play more or less hassle free, this place will run smoothly.

#
APPEALS
In some cases, people who have been penalized for breaking a rule believe
that they have grounds for appeals.  Should you feel that you want to
appeal a decision made regarding yourself, make sure that you remember the
name of the immortal who judged your case!

Decisions made by an immortal can be appealed to an immortal of 
administrative rank.  At this point a different protocol must be followed.

The decisions of an immortal may be appealed only directly, preferably via
email, to an &PADMIN&n.

See Also:  RULES_1, RULES_2, IMM_RULES

#
SHARING PSHARING

We will allow you to share your characters, but with this you
will have no support from immortals.  If you have some problem due
to the fact you are sharing, (ie, your char gets screwed up, loses
something, or say someone does something bad with the char to get
it in trouble, etc) then you will be out of luck, no help for you.
So Pshare at your own risk.

&R*NOTE* Giving your character to another player does not fall under 
         the psharing catagory, thus is quite illegal.&n
#
LOOTING

Looting of other players corpses when they die is against mud rules.
If caught your character will be punished.

Looting of equipment and cash off mobs that someone else kills is also
against the rules and will be treated as though you looted a players corpse.

CLAN CLANS
Crimson 2 offers players the ability to join clans after reaching level 10.
Clan leaders run the clans, and immortals have no control over clan
acceptance or rejections.  Type clan list for a list of available clans.

Clans serve different purposes.  They can be a collective of active and 
friendly players, a group of people with similar ideas and playing styles or
a group that serves a function within a mud.  Purely social clans are not 
created.  Clan activity is essential to sustained clan existence.

Clans who lose player activity (fewer than 50% of members log on within a month)
will be disabled.  Reactivation will be based upon attendance, as well as a fee (as 
shown in CLAN PRICING).

&RUnder no circumstance will a clan owner be allowed to operate two different
clans.&n

CLAN FOUNDATION, CLAN GENERAL, CLAN RULES, CLAN COMMANDS,
CLAN RANKS, CLAN PRICING, CLAN RENOVATION


#
"CLAN FOUNDATION"
Not just anyone can start a clan, you must first be approved by the
immortal in charge of clans, and your application must meet the
following minimum requirements:

1. Must be of a medieval or fantasy theme
   - No current real world themes
   - No futuristic sci-fi themes
   - No off-the-wall names.  Your clan name should reflect C2's themes. 

2. Originality
This doesn’t mean you have to use a made-up name all the time.  It is
appreciated to see some original ideas based on C2 themes.

3. Keep it clean
Clan channels are privately set up for clan members to discuss matters
without the rest of Crimson Mud 2 being privy to the information.
Derogatory language or racial / sexual / religious bias are not tolerated
in any form, and should be restricted to person-to-person tells if such
conversation is engaged.  Public channel abuse and clan channel abuse is
prohibited.  SEE HELP CHANNELS.

4. Clan Halls
Clan creation does NOT include the formation of a clan hall.  There will be 
a 2-week adjustment period available to imms to gauge how you perform with
your clan, if you can keep it together and expand.   Clans must exist for a 
purpose, not just for show. Clan hall expansion will depend on size and 
activity of the clan.

5. Other things
Just because you meet most requirement doesn’t mean that you will get a clan.
Your clan will need approval from an administration imm (ADMIN).  We won't let
you just get a clan just to have one. We want your clan to be active, work as
a clan and such. Eventually we hope to have clans have a bigger role, and have 
more to them, right now it.s more of a team with no game. Work out your game 
plan, and eventually your team could be a major player in the development of
Crimson Mud 2.

If you are interested in starting a clan, please contact (e-mail or mud mail)
the immortal in charge iof clans (as of this point, RogerWaters).

Your application should include:
    1.  The type of clan you wish to run. IE, the theme of the clan.  It  
        should be along the lines of a medieval or fantasy theme.
    2.  Check help CLAN PRICING for the four levels of purchase.
        Also check CLAN RENOVATIONS for additions to clan halls.

**Note  any inactive/disabled clans who want to start back up must have at least 
        5 members lined up if they have no clan hall or 10 members if they do 
        before they will get the clan re-enabled.  Clans may be enabled at mud
        mud administration discretion, and are NOT guaranteed to be re-enabled.

#
"CLAN GENERAL"
All existing help files on clans are still in draft form.  Please keep
this in mind and read over them again before you apply!

On Crimson 2, your clan status depends on two things, activity and attitude. 
You can only be a member of one clan at a time. Each clan has its own rules, 
requirements joining restrictions and themes, we suggest you choose one you 
like by looking at the descriptions provided for each clan, and by talking to
its members. To apply to join a clan, you must be level 10 or greater.
Each clan may have a minimum acceptance level, so always check the clan
description.  To do this, type "clan info <clan number>." For example, clan info 5.
The clan number may be found by typing "clan list."

#
"CLAN RULES"

* Clans may not in any way contribute to any anti-social behavior.

* The clan leader(s) may not set rules that conflict with the basic
  rules of the mud.

* The clan leader(s) are responsible for all members.  If a member(s)
  breaks rules and the situation within the clan isn't handles correctly,
  the clan may be suspended. IE, Phoenix a high ranking member of Sloth
  Clan decides to break a few rules, and gets caught. If clan does nothing
  to punish Phoenix within the clan for disrupting the rules of the world, 
  it might put the clan in jeopardy. Clans are an exercise in role-playing, as 
  well as a feature of the mud.  Clan leaders should exercise their authority 
  in making sure clans adhere to the rules and practices of Crimson Mud 2.

* If a clan chooses to purchase a clan house, no member of the clan may
  leave keys of OMAX designation anywhere in the clan house.  A first offense 
  is punishable by purging of the clan donation room and any other room in
  the clan house that is stocking items.  A second offense will be punished by 
  disabling the clan for 1 week.  A third offense will be punished by the permanent 
  disabling of the clan which no money may rebuy.

BREATH
The most powerful ability of a dragon is the ability to breath strong and
powerful elements at a victim.  With the lineage of the dragon-kin comes
this great force of will to breath anything from gas to fire to frost and
lightning.  The dragon-kin is a most feared creature due to these natural
offensive attacks.

the syntax for using a breath attack is: breath (type) (target)

example: breath fire guard

types of breath:
   MOBS
      fire -      ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4)/ 2)
      frost -     ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4)/ 2.5)
      acid -      ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4)/ 3.5)
      lightning - ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4)/ 3.5
      gas -       ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4)/ 4)

   PLAYERS
      fire -      ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4) /2.5)
      frost -     ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4) /3.5)
      acid -      ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4) /4.5)
      lightning - ((level + 1d4)*(level + 1d4) /5)

IMM IMMORTAL IMMORTALS

First, all immortals are EQUALS with the exceptions of the bosses.
The immortal levels exist as a form of job differentiation.  People
with specialities grouped together to do what they do best as immortals.

&W** S&wp&Wir&wi&Wt  **&n
This is a purely social level and NOT a part of the imm staff, so
please let these lost souls rest in peace.

&C** Immortal **&n
These people manage different roles on Crimson 2. Some have the ability to
perform multiple roles. The roles available to the IMM staff are: QUESTOR, 
MEDIATOR, BUILDER, RULER. If you have questions or issues please ask on of
us for help and if it is not within the immortals roles they will be able 
to contact another immortal that can assist.


&P** GOD **&n
These people run the mud.  End of story.  What they say GOES.  Generally,
the bosses will consult with other immortals before weighing in on anything
they may become involved in.  The bosses are the guides of the MUD's 
direction.

#
IMM_RULES
    These rules are for players of IMMORTAL rank and above. Avatars
have their own set of specific regulations. (Help AVATAR)  We do hope
that most of this is common sense to those of you who have progressed
this far.  There is 1 basic rule that you must follow, the rest of
this list is just an extension of this.

       Do not do anything with your immortal that will in any way
       affect the gameplay of mortals.  The only exception to this
       being authorized quests.  You may not use your immortal to
       explore areas or skills your mort does not have.


      1.  Do not kill mortals or mobs. And dont think that transferring
           or summoning them to aggressive mobs doesn't count.
      2.  Do not use your immortal to assist mortals in gaining
          knowledge, gold, equipment, or anything similar.  Players may
          be given simple directions, usually newbies to newbie areas,
          but that is all.  We aren't heartless and if a player is dying,
          you can cast heal on them.  Don't make it a habit. Sometimes it 
          requires dying to get the message across.
          The restriction on knowledge doesn't mean you can't teach a
          player how to mud.
         &R**This also includes not giving out the sites of other mudders.
        ***This also applied to information on ANY Immortal Board.&n
      3.  Immortals are here to HELP Crimson 2.  Personal power or influence
          are not goals that imms should have.  If an immortal stops being 
          of service or value to Crimson 2, their immortality may be 
          removed.

#
IMM_RULES2
      4.  Do not use trans or summon to move mortals to mobs or mobs to
          mortals.  After all they do have legs.  Let them walk or run.
      5.  Do not give out free equipment.
      6.  If you want to visit someone and it doesn't involve saving their
          butts from combat or being lost you may move them to a safe spot
          to talk.   Even if a newbie is lost, let them get a summon or find
          a recall on their own.  Its a lesson better learned at an early
          age.
      7.  Immortals may not have their mortal characters on at the same time
          as their immortal, apart from in exceptional circumstances, which
          must be approved by a ADMIN.
      8.  Do not use your immortal to explore zones or stat items and mobs,
          even if you have encountered them as a mortal unless there
          is a need for that information.  Do not use your immortal to
          stat players for your own use.
      9.  You may not share nor sell your immortal character.
     &R10.  Do not reimburse or give prizes and such to your own mortal.
          Please ask another immortal to do it for you.&n
     11.  NOBODY is above the rules.

&R     ** If you are unsure of anything, ask. Don't just stumble along. **&n

AVATAR (level 41)
Avatars are semi-immortals. They have climbed the ranks of mortal man, and 
now roam the world as monuments of perfection.  Once you reach the level of
Avatar you gain some minor god commands and can still adventure, but ONLY 
under the defined rules.  You may either continue to adventure like this, 
building your character up tougher and tougher. Once you reach this level 
you may possibly become a full immortal (See: IMMAPP)

        Avatars do not get *ALL* skills/spells upon reaching the AVATAR
    level.  They are allowed to practice up to 50 skills/spells that are
    not included in their initial class package.  The experience point 
    cost for these skills is a bit higher than your class skills, but 
    that's the price you pay for flexibility.
    
    *WARNING* Choose your initial class carefully as you will retain 
    that class after reaching the Avatar level.  Avatars get special
    criticals depending on their initial class, which could be a 
    critical attack, backstab, or  spell.  More may be added on this
    at a later time.   

RULES:
     We expect you to be mature enough that you won't use your powers
to abuse mortals via pkilling.  Its also requested that you use common
sense when helping mortals level. You are still bound by the persecution
rules in HELP PKILLING.

    all character data and items so that any recently made gains are not 
    lost.

#
STRING
For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.
The format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short               (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title               (for players)
Description         (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description  (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you 
enter a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the 
string until you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line
with a '@'.

#
LOAD
For loading new objects or characters from the database. The format is:
load <type> <number>
Where <type> is either 'obj' or 'char', and <number> is the number of the 
object or character you wish to create.

#
ALIAS
    FORMAT: alias
                 To get a list of alias commands.
            alias <command> <action1;action2;action3;...>
                 To set/replace an alias command
                 Use a ';' to perform multiple commands.
            alias <command>
                 To remove an alias.

    You can define an alias:
        Example: alias gbb get bread bag
    Alias's can be strung out by separating aliases with a ;
        Example: alias gbb get bread bag ; eat bread
        The above would both get bread from a bag and eat it.
    You can also use $* as a positional field for arguments to the alias.
        Example: alias heal cast heal $*;diag $*
        The above would do the following if you enter: heal SunShine
             cast heal SunShine
             diag SunShine
    Alias <alias name> without an argument after it will delete the
    alias.

    Note:  Do to scheduling, some commands such as attacks and spell
           casting might not occur in the order in which you have them
           defined in the alias.  This is not a bug and you need to
           experiment to find what works.

#
SAY TELL WHISPER ASK
If you consider communicating with other beings, you need to start
your sentences with either say,tell,whisper or shout.

       Example : say I can kill sly with a long sword.
	         tell Kalin I want turn in my cookie!

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:
            ' hello there.

Note: these are now sensitive to ".","?", "!", "&", ")" and "("'s. When
you use them you state, question, exclaim, sing and say happily and sadly.

#
QUI SHUTDOW
Just to prevent accidental quittings and/or shutdowns.
This command doesn't DO anything, it simply is.

#
TOP
There are three top 20 lists which can be viewed using the top command.
These are scores, kills, and deaths.  Type score to see your score (Your
kills/death score is : ) or attribute to see your kills and deaths values
(victims and rotting corpses).

    Usage:  top <list>
    Available lists:  scores, kills, deaths

Your kills/death score is calculated based upon your level and the levels
of every mob you kill.  When you kill a mob, if you are a lower level
than the mob, your level is subtracted from the level of the mob and this
value is multiplied by 5.  To this number is added 10 and the final value
is added to your kills/death score.

If you are of the same level or a higher level than the mob, then your
level is subtracted from the level of the mob and 10 is added to this
number.  The value is then added to (or subtracted from!) your kills/death
score.  Therefore, you will never lose more than 10 points of your
kills/death score with one kill.

It is all terribly complicated of course, but it boils down to the fact
that you get more points for killing mobs higher level than yourself than
you get for killing mobs lower level than yourself and if you kill mobs of
too low a level you may even lose points!
#
KILL HIT

A good way to start a fight.

Another good way to start a fight.

#
PARRY DEATH BLOW

Parry death blow is a very useful skill developed by many great fighters.
With this skill you will actually dodge a full melee attack for the full
damage.  If you become very skilled in this ability you will learn that
it will be one of your best friends in unfamiliar territory.

#
KICK

One of the very basic fighting abilities is that of kicking your opponent.
You will find that kicking can give you a very nice edge in some battles,
but be warned that if you are running low on your stamina (movement) that
your may not be able to flee out.

Levels 1-19  -- 3 round delay
                No Move Cost

Ninja Form   -- 1 round delay
                No Move Cost
                100% of damage

#
BASH

Bash can be one of the most powerful abilities any fighter can obtain.  It
can be said that even with the small damage that is delt the effects are 
far greater.  A bash can stop someone from casting heal spells and can stop
someone from an offensive move.  Use this power with great respect as it
can turn around to bite you back.


The success of a bash depends upon two things.
     1) Your skill in bashing.
     2) The victim's dex and difference between your
        level and victim's level.   For example, A newbie would
        find it impossible to bash a level 40 mob.
  To bash someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you
  succeed you will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on
  it's rear. The victim will be unable to issue any commands/spells for 2
  rounds of violence. If you miss you loose your balance and fall.

  A bash makes you unable to type commands/spells for 2 rounds of violence.

Player vs Player bashing:
If you are wearing a shield you have a chance of blocking.
That chance is greater if your dex is higher than the person
bashing you.

#
RESCUE

In any great group or party the ability to rescue your fellow members is
one of the most esential things you must learn.  The ability to take over
being hit to save the life of another is one of the most honorable ways
one can imagine.  This ability will make someone stop attacking a player
and start attacking you.

#
STEAL

What makes a thief a thief is the ability to steal.  There have been many
great techniques in the past but the tried and true still remain.  You 
steal anything not currently being worn from a player or a monster
including cold hard gold.  

Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires at least 1,250 XP
points to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters
at all levels.

Example:

>steal gold drunk

>steal sword mercenary
  (only possible if he is sleeping)

#
ENVENOM WEAPON

A skill usuable only by thri-kreens, envenom weapon is a process that
places poison on a weapon to increase the damage it does to a mob. The
poison is permanent, but cannot be placed on weapons with affect bits
(ie, hitroll, damroll, etc).

useage: envenom <target item in inventory>
example: envenom serrated

#
BACKSTAB

Backstabbing has been a thief skill for as long as the greatest seers
can look.  This ability gives an unsuspecting victim a serious wake up
call.  With a backstab you can take any piercing weapon and sneak
behind a victim and place the dagger right between the shoulder blades.
Upon a sucessful backstab the damage will be one of the strongest attacks
anyone can imagine.

LEVEL       MULTIPLIER
 1 --  4         2
 5 --  9         3
10 -- 14         4
15 -- 19         5
20 -- 24         6
25 -- 29         7
30 -- 34         8
35 -- 39         9
   40           10
   41           11


The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild. You can always backstab sleeping
persons.

Note:  Sneaking around may help influence your ability to backstab. ;)

#
CAST

For "magical" people. If you want to throw a spell at someone or something.
  Example : cast 'burning hands' <player>

Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by single quotes!!!

Single word spells can be cast without quotes.
  Example : cast heal Bird

Spells can also be cast by the spell number seen when you type practice.
  Example:  cast 4 <target> will cause blindness to be cast upon the target.

See also : help on each individual spell, for example:
  > help cure ligh
  > help ventri
  > help energy drain

#

                      ground.  Use this command with care.&n
  purge <object>      To remove an object.

#
STATS

#
SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is 
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, 
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

#
PRACTICE PRACTISE PRACS

   Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practice a certain amount
depending on how much experience you have available for practicing new 
skills.  Each skill has a different cost in experience points for each
% gained.  This depends on the level you acquired the skill and what %
the skill is at.  The more you learn the skill the more experience it 
requires to get better at it.

    A guildmaster can only teach you to 60% proficiency.  You have to
gain additional skill via actual use.  You might or might not gain
proficiency before 60%, but you'll have to learn that on your own.

See also: SKILLS, WISDOM

#
EXITS

Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course, the less
obvious ones won't show up here - you have to THINK in order to locate those.

#
LEAVE

If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.

#
ENTER

If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you'll enter any nearby shelter.
You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for example, 'enter window'.

#
TIME

Gives you the current 'gametime'.  Your initial reaction to the output
of this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.
You'll have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend
on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for
example.
   Note: Also displays game uptime and Eastern Standard Time.

#
BUG TYPO IDEA

For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. Examples:
typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'
When you use this command, the room you are standing in is reported so if
the typo is in the room, then you need be no more specific.  However, if
you have found a typo in a mob, object, or help file, you have to try to
be more descriptive.

Bug and idea provide more room for you to describe the problem/idea.  For
example typing 'bug game crashes' will bring up an editor that will let
you write one line at a time a description of the bug you have found.
Typing 'idea food' will bring up an editor that will let you write one
line at a time a description of your ideas concerning Crimson cuisine.

Exploitation of bugs is a very serious offense.  If you learn of a bug that
can cause crashes or affect game play and you EXPLOIT this bug, punishments
up to and including deletion and / or siteban MAY BE USED.  Bugs should be
reported promptly.  Regardless of situation, bugs should not be kept secret
from immortals, or used to benefit individuals for personal gain.

#
QUIT

When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
Note that all of your items will be stored except for no rent items and
you will enter the game next at the spot where you quit but there are some
areas from which you cannot quit, you have to cut your link and wait for
your character to autorent (autoquit these days).

#
INN INNS

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you may use inns to store 
your gathered equipment while you are not playing the game (we all have to 
sleep sometimes, there is no shame in that).

This mud does not require you to rent, you simply have to quit but we
still maintain the atmospheres of the local inns!

See also: OFFER, RENT, QUIT

#
OFFER RENT
For use in the receptions of inns. The command 'offer' will make the 
innkeeper tell you the cost of storing your character for different amounts
of time but it really doesn't make much difference as you can't rent anyway!

Besides, why would you want to?  Just type quit all of your items which
are not no_rent will be stored for you to come back and play another day!

See also: INN, QUIT

#
GET TAKE
If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick 
it up. 
  Example: "get greatsword"

If you are in a hurry, or if you just feel very greedy, you may type 
"get all". You can also use 'get' to extract objects from containers. 
  Example: "get dagger from bag".

See also: DROP PUT

#
PUT

keyboard.

#
NEWS

This command will show you the current edition of "Crimson 2 MUD Herald", a
publication dedicated to news and useful information about this world. It's
a very good idea to check it out once in a while.  Keep in mind that the 
newest of the news will be located at the top.

#
SLEEPING SLEEP WAKE RESTING REST SIT STAND

For changing your position. If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea to
sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.  Wake will automatically 
awaken and stand your character up.

#

  Example:
            pour foutain barrel
            fill barrel from fountain

#
GRAB

For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE

#
FOLLOW

If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why not
simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are following
someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you've got to do is follow
yourself: "follow <your name>".

SEE ALSO: ORDER

#
FLEE

If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto! you are out of harm's
way - that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't
simply bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live
forever?

#
EMOTE

This command is for any social's you may want to use, which are not actually
implemented as a separate social command, as listed in help social.

It's usage is simply: emote <string>
eg; emote feels cheerful,  typed by the character Zeon would be seen as:
"Zeon feels cheerful, to everybody in the room."

Also, you may use the characters $n in the string, and your name will be
placed here instead of at the start of the message.
eg; emote A large piano drops onto $n and squashes him flat, would be seen
as: "A large piano drops onto Zeon and squashes him flat."

#
GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

where 3022
      tells you where long swords are located.
where OBJ <object>
      tells you where objects are located.

Mortals can only "where" monsters or players, and only from their own zone.
Immortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where everybody is.  
Immortals can type where <number> to see where all objects of that number 
are located.

    A caution when using "where" by an imm. You can spam yourself into
    linkdeath.
      Example:
        where guard <--usually a bad idea if you have a bad link.

#
USERS

Tells you who's logged on to the game, and where they are playing from.
Command also accepts a CLEAR argument which causes it to purge UNDEFINED.

See also AVATAR IMMORTALS

#
BRIEF

Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room, and the people and objects
in there. Unless you are very familiar with the area in which you travel,
however, it is not advisable to use this command. Frequently, you will find
small, but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at 
your surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

See also: COMPACT

#
!

Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

#
CONSIDER

Usage : consider <monster>

This command will compare several of your attributes against the char/mob
you are considering.  This command will show the actual calculations of
the player in the 'YOU' column, and an estimate of how powerful or weak
the considered mobile is in the 'OPPONENT' columns.  The fields of
information in the command are as follows:

Level          : Compares your level versus the mobile's level.
Hits           : Compares your maximum hit points versus the opponents.
Magic          : Compares your magical abilities against the opponents.
Damage Ablility: Compares your ability to cause damage versus the opponents.

Example:
>con fido

By using this command, you agree not to hold Crimson responsible for any
losses real or perceived which result from your relying upon data provided.
Further, you agree to be happy with the additional data and won't grip or
complain about it.

#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.  After level 5,
you will advance one level at a time.   A level 1 to 3 char can gain
multiple levels with one kill.

Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

  * There are occasional rush periods which allow you to earn twice the
    experience for the same kills.

Some of us discourage killing of other players.  Some of us may take action.
The choice is yours.  Can you take a group of high levelers?

See Also: GROUP RUSH

#
RUSH

Rush is a special aspect of Crimson Mud that allows you to earn twice as
much experience for the same kills for a brief time.  There is a rush
period every 1.5 to 2 hours lasting from 1 until 10 minutes randomly.

You are able to purchase rushes from immortals at this time, the price
is as follows:

10 minute rush: 100 mil gold
20 minute rush: 200 mil gold

*NOTE: Rushes may only be purchases at the 50 minute or less mark before
       a normal in game rush.  You type rushtime to see this.
       example: Next rush in 0 hours 49 minutes and 40 seconds.
       Rushes MAY NOT be purchased after the 25 minute mark has been passed.
       
These are the only accepted times, no more, no less.  This maybe be subject
to change at anytime, the time or pricing.

See: EXPERIENCE

#
GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP ALL

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equaly by level among the group. Experience points will only be
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of the
killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne both wish to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Now Dragon may group them in one of two ways:
1) Dragon  : "group dragon"
   Dragon  : "group redferne"
   Dragon  : "group quifael"
or
2) Dragon  : "group all"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

      Use <Wand> <Target>
      use <item> <optional target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful,
and yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

Other items can be used and only trial and error will reveal uses.

#
"OHELP_BALANCE"
All eq is developed using a point system.  There is an ohelp file for each
body location detailing the points available for each level as well as
maximum damage, hitroll, and ac constraints.  Some of these values are
presented in decimal form but this is solely for continuity so please
always round down.

No deviation from this chart will be allowed without the permission
of the IMM staff.

The points are distributed as follows:
        1 damage = 20 value points
        1 AC = one value point
        1 stat (hit, mana, move) = one value point
        1 hitroll = 15 value points
        container = 10 value points

No value has been placed on attributes and special abilities
(invisibility, strength, etc) so that there is still plenty of variety
among items but that does not mean that you can go over board!
Powerful additions to weapons add 40 points.

"MHELP_MATTACK" MATTACK
    Allows you to set multiple attacks for mobs.   The following
explantion provided by Cyric:

mattack <mob> <slot> <type> <skill second> <skill third> <skill forth>
  <mob> is the mobiles vnum.. that should be obvious
  <slot> is the slot number for the special attack between 1 and 4
     it works kind of like oaffects with mobs being able to have up to
     4 different style attacks(note the slot isnt the second/third
     attack skill, a mob can have 4 attacks.. with each attack
     consisting of multiple hits.. just hit Wraith Lord Moorgash for a
     good example;>)
  <type> is the type of hit the attack :-NONE, HIT, BLUDGEON, PIERCE,
     SLASH, WHIP, CLAW, BITE, STING, CRUSH..
  <skill second/third/forth> are the skills like the ones for pc's
     a value of between 0 and 99 for each of these gives the percent
     chance of the hit.. given you successfully achieved the last extra
     hit.. you cant get a fourth attack if you didnt get the third attack.
     (see help pracs)
so an example for a mob that claws with a 50% chance of a second
attack.. then bites with no chance of a second attack.. then finaly
a slash with a 40% chance of a second.. then 50% of a third and 50%
of a fourth would be:
matt 1000 1 claw 50 0 0
matt 1000 2 bite 0 0 0
matt 1000 3 slash 40 50 50

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your healt in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

#
MUZZLE
    There are a couple levels of muzzle.  If an immort believes your
language/statements to be inappropriate, the immortal can apply a
muzzle flag to your character at the discretion of the immortal.  This
flag will prevent your char from speaking or performing any actions which
result in sound.  This flag must be removed by an immortal before you can
speak again.  Have a care, some immortals will muzzle for offenses so
slight as excessive spam while some may be less easily annoyed.

    There is also an AUTOMUZZLE flag that is automatically applied if
you use inappropriate language on gossip, shout, or auction channels.
The AUTOMUZZLE flag is automatically removed after 24 hours RL time. Use
the SCORE command to see how much time remains.  DO NOT ask an immort to
remove it!  If you got the flag, you can pay the penalty.   Keep in
mind also that the MUZZLEALL flag can be applied at anytime.

    IMMORTALS:  If you muzzle a player, please post on the immortal
                board that you did so, why you did it, and when it
                can be removed.  If a player ask you to remove a
                muzzle, please check the board and abide by the
                originating immortal's instructions.   If there is
                no post, go ahead and remove the muzzle.

                Force a player to gossip MUZZLE_ME_PLEASE and they'll
                have the 24 hour auto muzzle applied.

JAIL

    Jail is one of the last line punishments you can get before more
serious and permanent action is taken.  You can do nothing while in jail
not even gossip, although you will see yourself gossip, it will not go to
the rest of the mud.  Your only form of communication is through the
appeals board.  On which you will see why you were jailed and for how
long.  You may plead your case there, however if it has come to you being
jailed, you probably won't get a change of mind.  Very few offenses bring
jail as your first warning, but for those offences the second warning is
usually deletion.
     This is the place of last resort before your character is deleted
from the database.  If jail doesn't get the message across...

           NOTE: These are shown as [base/adjusted]

HUNGER THIRST
        Goes from 0 to n (Refer to your race to see how high it can go).
    A value of 0 means your starving.  You can't die from hunger, but
    it'll seriously affect regeneration of your hitpoints, mana, and
    moves.
        There are many items to eat such as bread, pastries, etc.

    NOTE:  Immortals and Avatars have a value of -1.

    available for use until you are at least level 6.

    Immorts can check on other players by using a name argument.

#
DEATH:
   When you die, you lose experience, your equipment remains with your
   corpse at the location of your death.  Your gold remains with
   you.  You should quickly return to your corpse before it decays and
   you stuff is left lying around for anyone to pick up.
   
   We do not allow players to take stuff from your corpse.  The exception 
   to this is when your killed by a mortal.  They are allowed to take one 
   item from your corpse. This is only when a mortal kills a pkiller.

See Also: PKILLER DEATHTRAP

#
DT DEATHTRAP
       These rooms kill you and subtract 200 from your kills/death score
and you will lost twice the experience lost during a normal death.
Avatars will also be affected by these rooms. Corpses can be collected
from the dressing room after re-entering the game.

NOTE: DeathTrapping can easily be avoided by looking where you walk
      for example if you type look west and west is a deathtrap you
      should get a good indication of it. Avats shouldnt deathtrap at all
      since they seldomly walk, they always can mistype a room number
      thouh teleporting in deathtraps also happens lots. You should
      confirm you teleport from safe zones only like midgaard or temple of
      t'salhoic where no deathtraps are found. Teleporting to mobs which
      are in deathtraps is the risk a person who teleports has to take.

#

      most likely only see these set on an immortal.

    you are AFK.  You also have an <AFK> in your title on the who list.
    Enter AFK to turn it off.  Players in the room are notified that
    you have returned.

#
WIPE

    The WIPE command will list all chars scheduled to be purged in 30
    days or less.   Because level 1 chars are purged after 30 days, and
    would fill up the list, they are excluded from the list so its not
    cluttered.

    Old characters are purged if they haven't logged onto the mud for a
    specified period of time.  These are displayed below:
           
    Level  1:       Wipe after 1 months of inactivity.
    Level  2 - 15:  Wipe after 3 months of inactivity.
    Level 16 - 29:  Wipe after 12 months of inactivity
    Of course, files can always be backed up if you think you might be 
    gone for longer than these periods.  You need to contact imms and 
    make sure your kit is backed up if you think you'll surpass the wipe
    limits.

VEHICLE

    Vehicles are available to transport you around the world.
Its possible some locations are only accessible via this means.
You can use the BOARD and EXIT commands when a vehicle is
loading/unloading passengers at a station.  You can't board/exit
a vehicle while its in motion.   A vehicle is always considered to
be in motion when its not at a station.

    Two things are required to set up a vehicle route.  The first
thing is to create a Vehicle object.   It must have type set to
VEHICLE and must not have a TAKE flag.   The objects cost is the
fare charged to board the vehicle.

    After creating the object, you need to set up the route it
follows.  There are 6 flags to assist with this.
ROUTENORTH, ROUTESOUTH, ROUTEEAST, ROUTEWEST, ROUTEDOWN, and ROUTEUP
The vehicle will look for one of these flags and head in that
direction.  A valid direction must exist when you set a route flag.
If one doesn't, the vehicle will stop in that room and be removed
from the list of valid vehicles.  You can set the link flags,
NOCHAR and NOMOB to prevent players/mobiles from entering vehicle
routes.

    The system looks for extended object descriptions of ARRIVAL and
INTERIOR.  The ARRIVAL message is sent to chars in the room when a vehicle
arrives at a station.  The INTERIOR is used to set a vehicles interior
description.

    The first ovalue can be used to set the chance a vehicle hits you. The
second ovalue will represent the % of your hits the damage will be. The
third ovalue is the minimum damage, The fourth ovalue the maximum damage.
See Also player flag: SHOW_VEHICLE,
         room  flags: STATION_NORMAL, STATION_REVERSE, VEHICLE_DEATH

RAGE

    Is the ability to go into a berserk mode of fighting.  Once in
rage, you cannot flee.  When you attack, each successful hit does
20% extra damage.

#
XYZZY

#
NEWBIE_ABBREVIATE NEWBIE_ABBREVIATION ABBREVIATE

The mud has been coded so that you only have to type as little as is
possible to identify what you wish to to do.

What this means, is that instead of typing 'look', for example, you can
just type 'l'.

Gossip becomes gos, inventory becomes inv, etc etc.

The same applies with the names of items, mobs and other players.
eg, 'wear sword' can become 'wea swo', 'smile sunshine' can become
'sm sun', etc etc.

Also, all mobs in the game can be referred to as 'mob', and all items
can be referred to as 'obj', so 'give sword cityguard' could become
'giv obj mob'.

This code is fairly unusual, but once you have become used to it, it is
very useful and a fairly nice luxury.

#
NEWBIE_BANK BANK

If you carry lots of money around with you all the time, it is at risk if
you are attacked by monsters.
Large amounts of money can be stored in the BANK, which can be found on the
map in this book (type 'look map').
To put money into the bank, type 'deposit <number of coins>'.
To take the money out again, type 'withdraw <number of coins>'.
to check how much you have stored, type 'balance'.

You can also store money at the receptionist in the same way, but she will
have a small charge for the service.

For further information, type 'help bank'.

#
"NEWBIE_COMMUNICATE" COMMUNICATION

You can communicate with the other users by a number of methods.
If you type 'who', you will be shown a list of the other players currently
in the game.
If you wish to speak directly to one of them, type
tell <player> <message>,  eg
tell conan  hi dude!.

If somebody tells to you, you can use 'reply' to reply to that person by
typing 'reply <message>', eg reply thank you for your help!  You can also
use reply if you can't see who it is telling to you.

If you type 'look' you will be able to see who else (if anyone) is in the
same room in the game as you.  If you type 'say <message>', everybody in the
room will get the message.

Next are the "global channels", this means that everybody in the game will
hear, if you talk on them.  They are used by typing '<channel> <message>'.
You can use the SHOUT, GOSSIP and AUCTION channels, although 'shout' should
be saved for an emergency.
eg, gossip Hello World!
and everybody else would see
Gossip: [Conan] Hello World!

With all of these you should remember people play here for fun, and you
should not be abusive or offensive to others when talking on these channels.

Type 'help gossip', and ALL of the channels will be explained, although you
will not be able to see all of them until you have progressed further into
the game.

#
NEWBIE_DONATE NEWBIE_DONATION DONATION

The donation room is where generous players who find they have gathered more
equipment than they need can leave it for other players to find.
It is a very good place to check if you are very low level in the game.

Note, since this equipment is donated, you should not try to get all of it
unless you are actually going to use it.

When you have progressed a little, you may wish to donate items yourself
to help other new players.  This is done by typing 'donate <item name>'.

See 'help donate'.

#
NEWBIE_EQ

As you explore the game, you will accumulate more and more items of
equipment, some will be usefull and others will not.
To see a list of what you are carrying but are not actually USING, type
'inv'  (short for inventory).

To see a list of the items you are using, type 'eq' (short for equipement).
These items will be shown against where on your body there are being worn.
Most items will only fit a certain location, example boots will only fit on
your feet, and you need to try to find the best items for each place.

To pick up an item from the ground, type 'get <name of object>'.
To drop an item again, type 'drop <name of object>'.

To wear an item, type 'wear <name of object>',
and to stop using it again, type 'remove <name of object>'.

You have wield weapons.  For example,
     WIELD SWORD

When you look at another player, by typing "look <name of player>', you
will see a list of the items they are wearing.  If you are a thief you
may be able to see what they are carrying in their inventory (and possibly
try to steal it) but other classes cannot see this.

Further help can be found by typing help <keyword> :
EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY, WEAR, REMOVE, DICE

#
FIGHTING NEWBIE_FIGHTING

When you meet a monster, you can get a rough idea of how tough it would be
to fight against by typing 'con <monster name>' (short for consider).
Note this is only a rough guide though.
If you decide to fight it, you should type 'kill <monster name>' to
attack it, and you will then begin the fight.
If you are a magic user, you may be able to cast spells also... check the
SPELLS page for this.
If you kill the monster, you will score 'experience points', which will
help you toward gaining your next level, the process which makes you
stronger.
During the fight, you will be able to check on how healthy your opponent is
by typing 'diag <monster name>'.
If he seems to be very healthy and you are not, he may be too tough for you.
If this is the case, you can run by typing 'flee'.

See help on : KILL, DIAG, FLEE.

#
NEWBIE_HELP

The mud has a fairly detailed database of help files to explain how
everything works.  To use, you can type 'help' on it's own for a list of
some keywords, or you can type 'help <keyword>' to see details about that
certain keyword.
eg, help wear

#
WEAR NEWBIE_WEAR WEAR

If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.
For example : wear boots
wear all will equip all your eq and chose a weapon.

#
NEWBIE_MOVING MOVING

First off, you should notice on the right-hand end of your prompt, there
is something like 'ex[D U]'.
This is a list of the possible exits from the room you are in. N E S W U and
D, refer to north, east, south, west, up and down.
You can move in the directions shown by typing the first letter of the word.
If the letter in the 'ex[  ]' box is lower case, it means there is a door
in the way.
Doors can be opened and closed using the 'open <door name>' and
'close <door name>' commands.

See help on : NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, OPEN, CLOSE.

#
NEWBIE_PRACS PRACTICES

AS you progress through the game, you will wish to aquire new powers and
abilities, to make yourself more powerful.
Magic users, such as mages and clerics get mostly magic spells, whilst
fighters and theives get no magic, only skills.
Other classes such as paladin, are somewhere in between.

Each class has an appropriate "guildmaster", who can teach you new powers.
First you must find your guildmaster.  You can do this by typing
look map, to see the map in this book, and looking for which of the four
guilds is for your class.
When you reach your guild, type 'prac' for a list of things you can learn.
Typing 'prac <ability name>' will actually learn it a little better.
Your practices are limited to by the amount of experience you have gained.

If you type 'prac' when you are away from your guildmaster, you will be
given a list of everything you have learned.
You can choose from these things when you want to use a spell or skill.

For further information, type 'help practice'.

#
NEWBIE_RENT RENT

You don't have to rent from Crimson Mud.  Simply type quit and you will
re-enter the game where you left off!

#
NEWBIE_RESTING

After a fight or whilst travelling long distances you may find yourself
worn down.  You can correct this by sleeping or resting until you are
strong again.
The commands are 'sleep' to sleep, and 'wake' when you have finished,
OR 'rest' to rest, and 'stand' when you are finished.
Sleeping will heal you fastest, but you cannot see what it going on around
you at the same time.

If you go three north from the Midgaard Fountain, to the "By the Altar"
room.   At this room, enter PRAY and it will restore all your lost hit
points and heal blindness/poison.   It will also removed curses and
cursed items.  The healing part ends after you reach level 10.

#
NEWBIE_SHOPS

On the main street in midgaard, and in many of the other towns you will
find in the game, there are shops.

When you enter a shop, you can view a list of what is for sale by
typing 'list'.
Once you have decided what you want, typing 'buy <item name>' will buy
it, assuming you have enough money (gold coins).
If you want to sell something, you can type 'value <item name>' to check
how much you will be given for the item, and if you like the price you
can type 'sell <item name>' to sell it.

The midgaard shops can be seen on the map in this book.

Further information can be found by typing 'help <keyword>' :
SHOPS, BUY, SELL, LIST, VALUE

#
NEWBIE_SPELLS

The general way spells are cast is to type
'cast <spellname> <target>', although some spells do not need a 'target',
and you just type 'cast <spellname>'.

All of the spells and skills have specific help files, and these should be
read for more detail.

#
NEWBIE_STATS

How good your character is, is defined by your STATS and ATTRIBUTES.
Your STATS can be seen on your prompt, something like
[H20 M85 V80].
The H is hitpoints, or how much damage you can take before you are killed.
If it reaches zero you are dead.
The M is mana.  This is the power you use to cast spells.  If it gets too
low, you may not have enough left to cast all of the spells you wish.
The V is your movement points, and they go down as you walk around.
As well as on your prompt, these can also be seen when you type "score".
When you type score, the number in brackets is what your stats will be when
they are at full strength.
All three of these will return to normal when you "rest" or "sleep" for a
while.

Your ATTRIBUTES do not change whilst you are playing.  These are:
INTelligence, STRength, WISdom, CONstitution, CHArisma and DEXterity.
These determine a number of subtle things about how your character will
grow as you play, but for now we do not need to worry too much about them.

Further help can be found by typing help <keyword> :
HITPOINTS, MANA, MOVEMENT, INT, WIS, STR, CON, DEX, CHA.

#
NEWBIE_SUSTENANCE.

You will be immune to it's effects for a short time as a newbie, however
sooner or later you will find yourself hungry and/or thirsty.
To quench a thirst, you must find water.  There are a number of water
containers in the game, and an endless supply of water at the fountain
(see the map in this book).
Food can be bought from a store, of found in some areas of the game.
To drink, you type 'drink <container name>', and to eat you type
'eat <food name>'.
You can see HOW hungry/thirsty you are by typing ATT.

#
NEWBIE_WALKING

    Its how you get around.  You have movement points and each time you
walk somewhere, those points go down.  When they reach zero, you can't
move until you get points back.  As time passes, used up points are
restored.

    You can move around by typing the commands: n,s,e,w,u, or d to
go north, south, east, west, up, or down respectively.

    This section of your prompt will tell you which ways you can go:
ex[N U].  If the letter is in lower case, it means there is a closed
door in the way.  NOTE:  enter DISPLAY EXIT to turn the exit prompt
on and off.

#
NEWBIE NEWBIE_BOOK

	in as fast as possible.  In it is hopefully everything you
			need to get started smoothly.
		Note this book can be EATEN in emergencies.

Type 'READ PAGE <page name>' to read the book.  Page names are in

#
AUTOMUZZLE

    There is also an AUTOMUZZLE flag that is automatically applied if
you use inappropriate language on gossip, shout, or auction channels.
The AUTOMUZZLE flag is automatically removed after 24 hours RL time. Use
the SCORE command to see how much time remains.  DO NOT ask an immort to
remove it!  If you got the flag, you can pay the penalty.   Keep in
mind also that the MUZZLEALL flag can be applied at anytime.

The Currrent list of automuzzle words are:
shit, fuck, ass, whore, cunt, hail, and muzzle_me_please

An attempt to avoid being automuzzled will usually result in a godmuzzle
so it's advisable to either take the automuzzle, or find a better word
to use.

Also, exsessive use on the avatar and immortal channel may also result
in a god muzzle.  So please use some common sense.

#
PASSWORDS HACKING

We will not take responsibility for characters that are hacked, or abused
due to somone else knowing the password or sharing the character.
If your character is hacked or otherwise accessed by another person and
terrible things are done where an imm has to deal with the person that may
end in muzzling, jailiing or deleting, then we are sorry, but you will not
be compensated for those actions.

As with *all* your passwords, they should be impossible to guess, a three
letter password isn't security, it's foolish. If you think someone knows
your password, change it. We recommend changing your password once a month
or so to keep your character absolutely secure.

Any site found to be hacking characters will be banned totally and
probably permanently, and the system administrators will be contacted.
We have a *ZERO* tolerance level for hackers and will not put up with it.

#
BOARDS

There are several boards for reading in the town of Midgaard.  One is the
general Mud Board (also known as the mortal board) which can be found
in the Reading Room, 2 north and 1 west from Market Square (or 1 down
1 west 1 north 1 west from the Reception) (See: MAP)This board is the
second place to look for news (See: NEWS) about the mud,any new rules,
and to leave your imput about how things are going and to post any ideas.

A second board is the Social board which is in the Common Square which is
1 south from Market Square (See: MAP) This board is where you will find 
notes from other players saying hi, requesting help, hiring out their 
services, advertising their clans, and information about any current quests
or hellnights.

To write or post on a board you should first use "look board" to see what
messages are on there.  To read them use "read <##>" where ## is the number
you want to read.   This is an example of what you will see:

This is a bulletin board.  Usage: READ/REMOVE <messg #>, WRITE <header>.
You will need to look at the board to save your message.

If you wanted to read about the current quest you would use "read 4" for
example.

If you wanted to post a message you would use "write <title>" where title is
what you would want people to see when they look at the board.
After you type that you will be put in an editor to write your post and
will end it with a line with nothing but a "@" on it, for Example:

write example
Write your message.  Terminate with a @.


] this is just an example on how to post on the boards
] had this been an actual post it would consist of something
] meaningful
] -kinetic
]@

To save your post to be sure it will still be there after a reboot or crash
you must look at the board again:

21 : Sun May 11 (Kinetic)    :: example

If you decide you don't want your post on there you can always remove it
with "remove <##>" where ## is the number of your post:

remove 21
Message 21 Sun May 11 (Kinetic)    :: example removed.

   - Note: you can only remove your own posts, other posts can only be
     removed by higher immortals.

LOGVIEW

Usage: viewlog <file alias> [number of lines to display]

    This command is used for viewing log files online. There are several
valid syntaxes that can be used. If you type "logview" with no parameters,
it will display a list with file aliases on the left, and the path name they
refer to on the right. You will use these file aliases to tell this command
which log file you want to view. For the rest of the optional parameters,
please see the following examples.

    Example 1: logview mainlog
    (Displays the last 15 lines in the "main" log)

    Example 2: logview mainlog 10
    (Displays the last 10 lines in the "main" log)

#
LOGSEARCH

Usage: logsearch <file alias> [lines to show] <text to search for>

    This command is used to search log files for specified text. If you type
logsearch with no parameters, it will give you a list of file aliases on the
left (the name you will refer to the file as), and the path that each alias
refers to on the right. Logsearch accepts three parameters. The file alias
which I just explained, lines to show, and text to search for. Lines to
show is the maximum number of lines that you want to be displayed that match
your criteria. This is an optional parameter. If you do not specify the
max number of lines to show, logsearch will default to a max of 15. The text
to search for should be self explanatory.

As an example, if an immortal was stat'ing equipment/mobs illegally and you
wanted to find out who it was, you might type the following:

logsearch godcmds 50 stat

That would search the "godcmds" log and return the first 50 lines found that
contain the text "stat". This command is NOT case sensitive.

Credits for this command go to: Tyler Barnes<tyler.barnes@crcn.net>

#
MULTIPLAYING MULTIS ALTS MULTI-PLAY

Multiplaying is defined as using more than one player character online at 
a time.  This is not illegal for levels 1-41 and there is no set limit to
how many chars you can have online at a time (within reason).

We hope you will multiplay responsibly if you do so at all. This rule is
subject to change if abused.

Immortals MAY NOT multi-play.

Thank you,

C2 Admins

#
NEDRA

Nedra is a boon to all mortals.  Located up from Market Square, Nedra is
known to cast a few helpful spells when you take a moment to relax in her
room.

#
RAHNKARA

Rahnkara is the head priestess in the Temple of T'Salchoic.  You can buy
statistics, heals and cures from her.  She is intolerant of violence around
her, though.  You will not be able to fight when she is in the same room as
you are.

#
"NEW RULES"

You can not bid from Jail.  This is a bug and doing so will result in
anywhere from a longer jail time, (while frozen) or loss of items.

If something seems illegal, or seems like it could be against the rules
then theres a chance it is and by following through and doing it could
and can result in some form of punishment.  This falls under ALL rule and
non-rule catagories respect it.

If someone tells you something is a rule and you cannot find it in the
helpfiles, news, or posts, follow it as such until you can confirm it from
an administrator.  If you are still unsure you may ask a boss.

#
AGE

Age reflects the number of mud years that you have played on C2.
Age can be affected by amount of game play, plus equipment can alter age.
The higher the age you possess, the stronger your spells become.
Mana regeneration also increases with age.

#
KILL

A kill is any successful fight where a player ends the existence of
another player or a mob. The final awarding of gold/experience from
the kill indicates the successful kill.  If auto aggression is not
set, you may not necessarily kill a mob.  You may only incapacitate
on it.
Also a good way to start a fight.

SEE ALSO: HIT

#
GECHO

An immortal command.  Allows for messaging without giving
the name of the immortal using the command which is seen throughout
the MUD world.

SEE ALSO: ECHO

#
OEDIT

An immortal command, which is yet incomplete.

#
IGNORE

A command available for all players.  You can "block" irritable or
unwanted conversation from individual players by using the ignore
command.  For example, "ignore plato" would ignore player named Plato.

#
SPIRIT

This is to replace the Legend level.  It is a quasi state of exisitance.
You are not quite mortal, but not quite a god either.
This is a purely social level and NOT a part of the imm staff, so
please let these lost souls rest in peace.

#
NWIZLIST

Syntax: nwizlist (lists imms level 43-75)

        nwizlist [avat/spirit/god/all] (lists their respective titles)

Fairly accurate way of checking what imms, avatars, and spirits exist.

#
QUEST_GOLD

Most quests generally call for a generous amount of gold.  It is useless to
restrict exact amounts for individual quests.  However, these are the
suggestions I'd make:

For level 10 or lower, do not give out more than 1 mil gold per individual
in the quest.  Morts of this area do not require much gold at all.  Giving
out 1 mil gold should be rare in itself.

From level 10 to level 20, do not give out more than 3 mil gold per
individual in the quest.  Again, morts in these levels do not need much.
White potions and recalls are the major expenses for them.

From level 20 to level 30, do not give out more than 5 mil gold per
individual in the quest.  At this point, things are starting to get more
expensive, but they do not have any insanely bad mobs or rent issues, so
they don't need a solid gold base.

From level 30 to level 40, do not give out more than 10 mil gold per
individual in the quest.  These people are working on becoming avatars,
so they may be investing in avat gear, buying stats, etc.  These are the
levels where gold is appreciated the most as a prize.

Level 41, Avatar - Quests for avats are diverse, from the incredibly easy to
the perversely hard.  I would argue that there are occasions where 1 mil 
gold is understandable and where 100 mil gold is understandable.  I would 
say no more than 200 mil gold per individual on a quest.  If there is a 
quest that requires more than that per individual, the players were insane 
to accept that quest.

See also: QUEST_QPS

#
QUEST_QPS

QPS is already much simpler to handle than gold.  Each quest point is worth
10K gold IF SOLD TO QUESTMASTER.  However, to buy a quest point, it is 20K
gold. So using quest points in quests can be money savers OR money makers
for players.

Basically, follow equivalents for gold and qps.

Ex: level 1 to 10 with 1 mil gold max would thus be 100 qps.

See also: QUEST_GOLD

#
QUEST_EMAX

Here is the CURRENT list of what is considered max for each level base.
(this could change at any time, so always check up before loading things)
Max eq is NOT to be loaded in any quest.

Under no circumstance should any of this information of what is max be
given out or told to other players.  If you already knew it was max, as
your mortal you can say as such, but as your imm you cannot.  If you didn't
know, then it is immortal only information and should stay as such.

Lists are in the following individual helpfiles as it was too spacy for
one: QUEST_EMAX_41_EVIL,QUEST_EMAX_41_GOOD, QUEST_EMAX_30, QUEST_EMAX_20, 
QUEST_EMAX_10, QUEST_EMAX_NEWBIE

Second, NO_RENT eq is encouraged over regular eq, cause in most cases it is
better, or much better than anything that can be found, which compensates
for the lack of it being permanent.  Some NO_RENT eq is EXTREMELY good and
should have approval for use.  A list will be compiled of NON_APPROVAL
NO_RENT eq and will be located in the helpfile QUEST_NO_RENT.

Third, equipment that has fewer than 5 copies in the game cannot be used.
We do not want to compete with natural pop ratios.  Eq used in quests are
to SUBSIDIZE, not outshine, natural eq popping.

Fourth, do not use any eq with less than 3% pop rate.  Even if it isn't max
or second max.  This eq is meant to be intentionally rare.  3% or higher
pop ratio, please.

There are occasions when quest rules may be modified to fit situation, when 
pop % or # in game can be disregarded.  You must see an Administrator to go
beyond those rules.

DICE

This is a point of confusion for many.  Let's start with the basics.
First let's say you have a Serrated Short Sword at 2d8 damage.  
What does this mean exaclty?  Well this comes from the days of yore 
in  Dungeons and Dragons and other role playing games when it was 
all done with dice.   So what this means is it's the same as rolling 
2 dice with 8 sides each.  If you still don't understand think of a 
board game like Monopoly(tm).  In each turn you roll 2 dice to move.
The minimum you can roll is a 2, since there's  2 dice and the lowest 
number is 1.  The maximum is 12, since again you have 2 dice, with 6 
sides and the maximum of 6 on each die. So each turn you are moving 2d6! 
Get it?  Good! Ok.  Back to out 2d8 sword.  The minimum damage this sword 
will do is 2, since there's 2 dice.  The maximum is 16 since there's a 8 
sides on each die. Now as all of us Monopoly(tm) players know, neither 
one is very common. There are several dice average formula's out there, 
but a common one is like this: 
<# of dice> * <# sides>/2 + 3 
This looks complicated!  Not really.  
In our 2d8 example it would be 2 * 8 / 2 + 3 or, 16/2 + 3, or simply, 11.
So now you're thinking, ok, so the maximum is 16, the average is around 
11ish,  why am I hitting for 24 damage a round then?  Simple, you also 
have damage bonuses if you look in your attributes which come from 
attributes like strength and also from your equipment.  So if your Damage 
bonus is 15, you're swinging your short sword,  and your dice roll comes 
up 14, you add your 15 damage bonus and you just hit for 29!

If you still need help understanding, send detailed questions to
