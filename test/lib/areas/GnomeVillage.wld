Serene Forest~
This part of the forest seems to have a more peaceful quality than the 
forest surrounding it.  You sense a friendlier atomsphere as you turn to
smile at your companions.  There is a small sign hanging on a tree here.

Serene Forest~
Pacific is the word that first comes to mind as you travel through this
ancient wood.  Perhaps the largest tree in the wood is a short walk ahead
of you to the west.  Birds are singing like you've never heard them sing
before, and a fox runs across your path, disappearing into the brush.
A section of the path breaks away and leads north.

The forest looks more 'inhabitted' here.  The brush doesn't grow as thick
and many small trails branch out from the main path you are following.  A
big hint that intelligent creatures live here is the large hole carved 
through the bottom of the ancient oak tree to the west.

anything, even running into each other every once and a while.  Several
