&GThe Forest of Quel'Sith&n~
&n  Huge &Gevergreens&n and &yoaks&n stretch up into the heavens, their presense 
granting peace and comfort for the soul. Animals of every kind survive 
here. Brightly colored birds flit through the air, singing their merry 
songs. &WRabbits&n, &ysquirrels&n, &yweasels&n, and other small mammals are found in
abundance, as are &ydeer&n, &Kbear&n, and other larger species. None of these
creatures seems the least bit hostile, a special magical property unique 
to these woods.&n

&GCrossroads in the Trail&n~
&n  The path splits here, leading east west, and north. &GHeavy vegitation&n
surrounds the trail, threatening to overwhelm the walkway, and swallow
it from sight. The trees here are huge, some look as tall as a castle,
with huge branches as thick as a man is wide. Every now and then, movement
can be seen from the corner of your eye, but as you turn to look, whatever
caused the clamor is gone...&n

&GEntrance to a Small Glade&n~
&n  The plethora of trees suddenly gives way to a circular glade of
grass. No other foliage exists in the area, but a &wlarge stone&n is 
set in the middle of the area. Several &Kcharacters&n of a dialect long
lost are enscribed upon the stone. A feeling of peace and ease emanates
from the monolith.&n

off to the west, almost undistinguishable among the giant &ytrees&g.&n
