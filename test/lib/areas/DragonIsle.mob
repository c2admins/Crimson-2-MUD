You see a huge, Black dragon.  It stands on four legs, has huge

seems to shake...its attacking.

You behold a Large, Blue dragon.  It walks on four legs...
oddly...it has very small wings.  You wonder if this
creature can even fly.  It sees you...But doesnt even seem to
aknowledge your existance.  You walk closer...suddenly, it jumps 
to a full alert, and emits an ear piercing howl.
