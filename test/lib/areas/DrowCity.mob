  Unlike many female drow, Akordia was drawn to the powers of magic rather than duty to Lolth.
because of this, she is an outcast among drow, and her being in the weakest of the houses hasn't
helped her plight either. Still, she has maintained to scavenge a number items over the years 
to help her boost her magical prowess enough to rival the mages of the other houses.

it has not been uncommon for the young Baenre to make assassination attempts on rival masters to increase his
positioning.

&KA lithe, beautiful drow stands here is a flowing robe.&n
~
  The eldest of Chessintra's 'adopted' children, Laele is the eyes and ears for the family within the ranks
of the priestesses of Lolth. Her own family was slaughtered by house Maerrai when she was still a child, and 
the compassionate matron of house Lestel took the young girl under her own care, teaching her the ways of
Eilistraee. Since that time, Laele has served her family and Eilistraee in an unwavering fashion not normally
seen in drow. She is loyal, and trustworthy and can be trusted with any task assigned to her.
  Laele always carries an amulet of Eilistraee with her no matter where she goes. She realizes the risk, but
believes that removing the amulet would be akin to forsaking her goddess. No other drow other than Chessintra 
know of its existance, so for now she is safe.

&KImrae Coloara&w, weaponsmaster of &rHo&Ru&Wse Les&Rt&rel&n~
&KA fierce looking drow woman is here, practicing her sword techniques.&n
~
  The newest of Chessintra's adopted children, Imrae was a commoner raised without a mother. Her father, raised
in a matriarchal society, could teach her nothing more but what he knew...how to fight with a sword. When her 
father was killed on a surface raid, the young drow caught the eye of lady Chessintra while fighting a local
guard over some stolen mushrooms. Not only did Imrae hold her own with a sword, she mortally wounded the guard
before the matron stepped in to stop the fight and pay for the stolen goods. Within the Lestel household, Imrae
was taught the ways of Eilistraee. She learned it is not 'strange' for her to to be a warrior, for the goddess
herself slew her enemies with a sword. She has taken her teachings to heart, and thoguh she is a woman, is the
most skilled weaponsmaster in the city.
  Though she is often seen with a scowl on her face, and is considered by her peers as a fierce woman, Imrae
is actually very compassionate and warm, though she will only show this side of herself to her family.

~
   Though her 'family' is much stronger than many of the other rival houses, Chessintra has not openly 
challenged another house in several decades. She is a secret high priestess of Eilistraee, and open public 
wars would surely expose her for the fraud she is and destroy everything she has worked for. Not only has she 
protected and adopted the children of fallen houses, teaching them the ways of Lady Silverhair, but she has 
worked with an unknown partner to transport slaves and followers of Eilistraee to the surface for relocation.
  Being the youngest of the house matrons. Chessintra has yet to have children of her own and has not yet even
chosen a mate. She is very careful of who she trusts, for accepting the wrong person into her family could well
destroy her and her family.

mob deroune maerrai first house assassin~
&KDeroune Maerrai&w, assassin of &yHo&Yus&Ke Mae&Yrr&yai&n~
&KA short, but strikingly handsome drow man greets you with a smile.&n
~
  Deroune has one purpose, and that is to kill those his mother wishes dead. He always uses his fake kindness
as a facade to lure his victims to his lair, where they will then find a dagger placed firmly in their back.

mob talice maerrai first house priestess~
&KTalice Maerrai&w, priestess of &yHo&Yus&Ke Mae&Yrr&yai&n~
&KA rather young drow woman is here, dressed in the garb of a priestess of Lolth.&n
~
  Being the youngest of Rauva's daughters, Talice has always been rather ignored. Even her antry into the 
priestesses of Lolth has gained her little esteem in her mothers eyes, probably due to the fact that her elder
sister, Ginafae, is the high priestess. Because of this, Talice has become good friends with Laele Hune, and 
even sympathetic with her cause. Together, the two have become a powerful force within the ranks of the 
priestesses, and Talice is not afraid to use the Maerrai name to draw heat away from her friend.

mob gelroos maerrai first house weaponsmaster~
&KGelroos Maerrai&w, weaponsmaster of &yHo&Yus&Ke Mae&Yrr&yai&n~
&KA rather strong, stout looking drow stands here, sharpening a sword.&n
~
  Gelroos is the eldest of all Rauva's children. Because he is a male, he was never given many options in life, 
and thus he has built his body and worked through the ranks of the warriors. He now leads raids upon the surface
world, and his body bears the scars of his hard life. He accepts his role, knowing that he helps bring glory to
his family, and as long as his mother is happy with that, so is he.

mob ginafae maerrai high priestess of lolth~
&KGinafae Maerrai&w, high priestess of &yHo&Yus&Ke Mae&Yrr&yai&n~
&KA tall, very regal looking drow woman stands here, dressed in the garb of a high priestess of Lolth.&n
~
  Ginafae is the epitome of what a drow woman should be. Tall, beautiful, strong, and of course, ruthless. She
has worked her way through the ranks of the priestesses with an aggression that would make any drow proud, and
was hand chosen by the goddess herself to be the high priestess. Nobody has yet dared challenge Ginafae's
position, but as the ranks of the priestesses grow, there becomes more and more dissension among the ranks.

mob rauva maerrai first house matron~
&KRauva Maerrai&w, matron mother of &yHo&Yus&Ke Mae&Yrr&yai&n~
&KA tall, aged drow woman stands here, ordering servants about.&n
~
  Rauva is the oldest living drow within the city. She has learned many tricks over the years, tricks that has
helped her family survive countless house battles and made them the first ranked house in the city. Though she
is nearly a thousand years old, she still has much of the beauty she had in her youth, though her eyes show a 
dullness the exposes her true age. She is still quick minded, however, and still holds an iron grip on the 
Maerrai household. Anyone who has dared challenge her has ended up in the sacrificial pits, torn apart by the
minions of Lolth.

protection as well.

  Mylochar spiders are the personal servants of Lolth. They do not exist in the wild, but come instead from the
world of the spider goddess and are given to her priestesses to help exorcise her will.

mob drow servant~
&wa &Kdrow &wservant&n~
&wA &Kdrow &wservant works here, trying to remain inconspicuous.&n
~
  All servants within the drow community are male. The male of the species is looked at as inferior by the 
priestesses of the spider goddess, and thus given menial tasks for the weak or training as warriors and assass-
ins if they are fit enough to fight. A few may possess enough extraordinary talent to become mages, or even 
priests, but ranks given to males is very uncommon.

  Though not of high enough rank or nobility to be a house member, the drow overseers have risen to enough 
power within the drow society to take their aggressions out on the 'lesser' races....which is something they
enjoy thoroughly.
