the Border Guard~
The Border Guard stands here looking for trouble.
~
A young warrior by the looks of him.  You suppose that he is simply putting
in his required duty before being assigned to a real post.  He looks rather
bored, considering the lack of excitement that happens here.

mob Berinthraxus wyrm~
the Ancient Wyrm Berinthraxus~
The Ancient Blue Wyrm Berinthraxus welcomes you to your death.
~
You are gazing into the eyes of a gigantic ancient wyrm.  Berinthraxus'
appearance could put the fear of god into any brave warrior, it just happens
that you were the particular fool who entered his lair.  He stands taller
that a three-story house and you can't even judge how wide.  His scales are
thick and look like individual interlocking breastplates.  His claws are the
size of small giants and his mouth could swallow ettins whole.  His fangs
are stained with blood and he looks really pissed off.

Peacock, Hierophant of the Cabal~
Peacock, Hierophant of the Cabal, meticulously examines the grove
~
Peacock, appears almost like his namesake.  He is dressed in robes with
magnificently colored feathers flowing around him.  His hair hangs just
past his knees and is a rusty-brown color.  He is wearing no shoes or
leggings that you can see beneath his robes.  His movements suggest that
he is totally engulfed in his work and either doesn't know of your presense
or, more likely, doesn't care.  He is the highest ranking druid in all
the realms and he has more important things to worry about then you.

Sir Ludwig Von Henrics, the Blue Knight~
Sir Ludwig Von Henrics, the Blue Knight ponders your significance.
~
Sir Ludwig Henrics is the lord of the Tuscan cavaliers.  He stands before you
as a very imposing sight.  He is over six feet tall with dark brown hair and
brown eyes which seem to gaze right through you to your very soul.  There are
many visible scars on his face and neck and the dents in the shield that he
prominently displays, are no doubt from many vicious battles.  His shield
displays his coat of arms upon which are several symbols that you do not
recognize. Sir Ludwig is often referred to as 'The Blue Knight,' a name
derived from his suit of full platemail which has been enchanted to glow
blue. You also notice that he seems to have a lot of mobility for someone
wearing full plate, as well as the fact that he moves without making a sound.

This enormous beast has the eyes of a kitten.  He seems to look at
you as if waiting to receive a scratch.  Make no mistake though he
is one of the largest creatures you've ever seen.  The entire
roof of the tower is his lair.  From head to tip of tail you'd guess
him to be no shorter than one-hundred feet long.  His wings, although
tucked, appear as if they could block out the sun.  There is a
bright golden stripe down his back, starting at his neck.  His underbelly
is as white as ivory and you'd almost swear that his scales are made
of ivory.

A VERY old man is deep in contemplation.

A man who radiates such a glow must surely be magical.  His body
itself seems to give off a magical hue.  His white hair seems to
touch his ankles yet he has the face of a nineteen year old.
He never seems to be in one place, his body seems to move though
you are sure he is sitting perfectly still.  His cloak seems to
have a life of its own as well.  The greens of it seem to be a
smoke which moves about the purple fabric.
