Using Scrolls 101~
&GScroll&Bs.  They are magical items that do a variety of things.  Some let you
identify items.  Some allow you to recall to the City of Midgaard.  There
is probably a scroll for just about anything.  Scrolls can be used on mobs,
other characters or even yourself.  The way to use a scroll is by reciting
it.  If you had a 'Scroll of Recall' for example, you would type 'recite
recall <target>' to send that character back to Midgaard or type 'recite
recall' to send yourself back.  The Wizard in the Magic Shop sells Recalls and
other magical items.

Using Potions 101~
&GPotion&Bs.  They are magical items that also do a variety of things.  Some
let you heal yourself.  Some allow you to gain special abilites for a limited
period of time that you normally do not have.  There is, like scrolls, 
probably a potion for just about anything you can think of.  Potions are
for the most part used only by the person carrying them.  The was you use
a potion is by quaffing it.  If you had a 'Blue Potion of Healing' for 
example, you would type 'qua blue' or 'quaff blue' to regain some hit points.
The Wizard in the Magic Shop sells recalls and other magical items.  Some 
potions of interest and necessity are:  "Blue Potion of Healing" and "Yellow
Potion to See Invisible."

Using Wands and Staffs 101~
&YWand&Bs and &YStaff&Bs:  They are yet another sort of magical item that do
a variety of things.  Some let you cast 'fireball' at mobs.  Some allow
you to cast 'sleep' on a target.  As with Potions and Scrolls, there is
probably a wand and/or staff to do just about anything you can think of.
You need to know that there are also two different sorts of staffs in the
game.  One is a weapon and can only be used as such, and the other is a
magical item, which would be held.  Wands and Staffs must be held to use.
You would use them by typing 'use wand <target>' or 'use staff <target>.'
Many staffs, when used, not only hit your target, but also everyone and/or
everything else in the room.  A Staff of Sleep, for example, when held and
used by typing 'use staff <target>' in a room with four mobs, will try to
sleep on ALL four mobs.  The Wizard in the Magic Shop sometimes carries
staffs and wands and all sorts of other magical items.

USE WANDS STAFFS

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>
      Use <item> <optional target>

Using staffs will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a 
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful.
Staffs can be dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object or a mob.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

Other items can be used and only trial and error will reveal uses.

Casting Spells 101~
&GCast&Bing &GSpell&Bs.  Casting of spells if for magical people only.  When
you reach level 41 you will at that time be allowed to choose limited spells
of your choosing.  In order to use spells, you must practice them.  Please
refer to 'help MIDGAARD' for a map of locations of your guilds.
You can see what spells you are able to cast by typing 'prac.' Now to cast
them you can either type "cast 'spell' <target>" or "cast 'number of spell 
listed when you type prac' <target>."
You can type 'Help <name of spell>' to get info on that particular spell as
well.

In order to see what spells are currently affecting your persona, you would
simply type 'spell.'  Be warned though that 'spell' is a lvl5 command.

Using Abilities 101~
&RAbilities.&B  Abilities and Skills are pratically the same thing, except
that Abilities are something you're born with, and Skills will be something
you learn.  Each race has its own abilities that make them very hard to
choose between for new characters.  To see which races get what abilities,
we type 'help race' to get a list of races, then 'help race *name*' to
see the abilities that race comes with.  We will get into using those
abilities and the skills you later learn in the next room
north of here.

Using Skills 101~
&CSkills.&B  Skills are a bit different than spells in the sense of
how they are used.  You learn both skills and spells but they are
each used in their own ways.  Skills differ from abilities only in that
your abilities are given to you at birth dictated by your race.  Your
class will dictate which skills you can learn.  To see a list of
the skills your class can learn, type 'help class *class name*'.
This list will tell you what skill and at what level you will get
it at.  To practice skills, you m ust first reach that level and 
then find your guildmaster in Midgaard to practice with.

If you are unsure of how to use a skill, type 'help *skill name*'.
For example, if you wish to 'hunt' someone and are a level 35 Warrior,
you would either type 'hunt *target*' if you knew how to use it, or
'help hunt' to learn how to use it.&n

Using Social Commands 101~
&CSocials.&B  Social commands are a great way to express your feelings 
towards others and to let out some steam at times.  To get a list
of social commands, type 'help social'.  To use these commands you 
can either just type in the word, such as 'fume' or you can type in 
the word towards another player or mob, with 'grin *target*'.
Please note that expressing and showing emotion is a great thing, but
if you &gSPAM&B someone, you could get a headache by being approached
by an immortal.  Please use common sense in using social commands, 
and try to do unto others only as you wish done to you.

"GENERAL HELP" "HELP FILE"

Following help is available:

HELP help     - This test.
HELP          - List the available commands.

Help searches for a partial match of the entered word, including any
spaces that may follow the word.

Example -
> 'help magic mis'
   will find the help test for the magic missile spell.

> 'help mag '
   will not match anything.

> 'help mag'
   will match 'magic user' or 'magic missle' depending on the first
  occurrence in the help files.

Using Help Files 102~
&CHelp Files.&B  Help files can be pretty detailed as well.
In the last room, we learned how to get a general list of
help topics, which will assist you alot.  However, sometimes
you have to be more detailed in your usage of the help commands.

Typically, if a you need more detail than the general list has 
given you, you would then type 'help *topic*' to get more detail.
At the end of that help file you will also many times see a
"See also..."  These are related topics which might help you even
more.

Using Help Files 103~
&RHelp Files.&B  At times, you will be in search of a topic which
you just can't seem to find in the general list or related topics.
An example of this might be looking for help on the spell "Chill
Touch."  If you type 'help spell' you get a topic on the spell 
command which shows you which spells are currently cast upon you.
Further, 'help spells' will give you help information on basic
usage of spells, but not on a particular one.  So what to do?
Simply type in 'help chill touch' and you will get the help
on that specific spell.  That also applies to all other spells,
skills, and items.  If you can't find what you are looking for,
just ask over gossip and someone will point you in the right
direction

Mud Basics 101~
&CThe Basics.&B Most often any question you might have can be answered
by use of the help files.  You simply type in 'help "topic"' and you
should get an explanation on that topic.  Be warned that sometimes the
keywords are a bit different than one might think, so try a couple
different ones.  When help files fail to assist you, you can ask over
gossip or tells to another player for assistance.  Patience is a virtue
you will soon learn here.  Often players are very busy and don't even
notice a tell sent to them, or a gossip.  If you feel ignored, believe
the request was missed, and try to ask an immortal for help.

Some basic things you should do when you are new are the following--

Type "auto all."  This will set loot, flee, assist, coin on for all kills.
At level 2 type 'set flag show_diag on.' This will allow you to see the state
of a mob while you are fighting him.
To set color on your screen type 'Ansi on'.
To set new graphics type 'Set graphics new'.

be there when you require assistance. Everything you do has some sort of 
repercussion.  Be it rule breaking (jail time or worse), be it harassing 
(jail time or worse), be it helping (being known as a good player), or be 
it sticking to yourself (loner).  Just remember that people react to you
accordingly and you will be fine.

JAIL

Jail is one of the last line of punishments you can get before more
serious and permanent action is taken.  You can do nothing while in jail
not even gossip.  Although you will see yourself gossip, it will not go to
the rest of the mud.  Your only form of communication is through the
appeals board, on which you will see why you were jailed and for how
long.  You may plead your case there, however if it has come to you being
jailed, you probably won't get a change of mind.  Very few offenses bring 
jail as your first warning, but for those offences the second warning is
usually deletion.

This is the place of last resort before your character is deleted
from the database.  If jail doesn't get the message across.....

People on the Mud 101~
The people of this mud can be broken into three categories:
Mortals, Avatars and Immortals.  Mortals are the characters between the 
levels of 1 and 40.  Avatars are the characters who have attained level 41.
Immortals are characters who are level 48 through 50.  Spirits, level 47, 
are outside of the playing and administrative domain, and merely exist to
talk and observe.  Spirits are not immortals.

The immortals are broken down by their roles. Some immortals may have
multiple of the below roles:
MEDIATOR -  These are the mortal relations immortals. They server to help
mortals with problems, convey ideas from the mortals to the immortal zoners
and coders, and to help enfore a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere on C2. 

QUESTOR - These are the quest and event immortals. These imms have the
ability to load mobs and items for the purpose of enhanced gameplay. Quests
or events can coincide with holidays or can be held at a whim.

BUILDER - These are the zoning immortals. They have the ability to modify 
and create rooms, objects, mobs, and zones. Most of their work is performed
on the development port, but they may occasionally fix typos on this port.

RULER - These are the administrators of the MUD. The have the ability to
restart the ports, review logs, delete/undelete users.

All imms are to be treated with respect and to be listened to when they 
get involved in any matter pertaining to Crimson Mud 2.

avat~
AVATAR (level 41)
Avatars are semi-immortals.  They have climbed the ranks of mortal men and now
roam the world as monuments of perfection.  Once you reach the level of Avatar
you gain some minor god commands and can still adventure, but ONLY uder
the defined rules.  You may either continue to adventure like this, building
your character up tougher and tougher.  Once you each this level you may
possible become a full immortal (See: IMMORTAL) by one of two ways at this
time.  1) By asking an Ante+ who will then take your request up to be
considered, or 2) you will be approached by a higher immortal who sees your
contributions to the mud and use of good sense and asks for you to join.

NOTE - Advancig to ARCH is an irreversible step, and you cannot continue
        to adventure.  For no reason will your avatar be reimbursed.

Refer to HELP_IMMORTAL.

meth~
METHUSELAH

The Methuselah (meth) is the immortal level right above Arch.  A majority
of the immortals who express an interest in helping to run the mud are 
positioned here.  These immortals have the powers to peform basic law
enforcement, assist the implementation of quests and such.  They are a
direct liason between mortals and the HIGHER GODS.  If an Arch is not around
to assist you or if you feel an Arch's decision is incorrect, you would
appeal and/or approach a Meth.

LEGENDS

Legends are immortals who have worked or played on Crimson Mud II in the
past but, by time and other duties have sadly been unable to maintain
their duties in other positions.  When they are around, these immortals
can be helpful, just ask.  Their position is one of honor and as such,
they deserve just as much respect as all other immortals.

ARCH ARCH-AVATARS

The Arch-avat (Arch) is the first level of true immortality on
Crimson Mud II.  They are in a level of training for Meth in most cases,
so please be patient if they cannot help you right away.
They may be approached for rules clarification or help with
basics of the mud or mudding.

Is responsible for coding the mud.  In addition to this difficult task,
this person is always looking out for both the mortals and immortals of
the mud, often assuring from behind the scenes that everyday mud life
progresses smoothly and fairly.  This person can just do about anything mud
related, but request that you seek day to day help from the other immortals
and Gods as altering the world is a time consuming and weary business.

A Few Secrets 101~
If you go just North of your recall point (point at which
you arrive when you recite a scroll of recall),
and type 'pray' you will be healed.  Just remember
this only works until you reach level 10, at which
point you must find other means to heal.

A Few Secrets 102~
Up until about level 20, mortals can get free spells cast
upon them (minus sanctuary) from Nedra the Healer.
She is located just Up from Market Square in Midgaard.
You may rest here or sleep, as the regeneration in this
room is more advanced than in other rooms of the
mud.  Typically, Nedra casts upon you once every few ticks,
so it might be best to rest and wait.

The Courtyard~
You have entered a magnificent courtyard made of marble and granite.
The walls reach up unto the skies, and the flags of Midgaard fly high
above.  You note to yourself that you would someday like to climb
up on the parapets of this find city and view the surrounding areas.

There is a great command called 'scan' that you will need to learn 
before you venture out into the world.  When you wish to see who or
what lies around you, simply type 'scan' or 'scan *direction*' to see
what is in that direction.  Try it here and see what you find.  Don't
worry the Pets won't harm you, they'll actually reward you if you
take their tests.

Return to Midgaard ~
Remember your training young mudder.  Keep it in mind and also
keep in mind to always keep an open mind to new things and new
lessons.  Don't treat others with disrespect, nor try to harm
them in any way.  You wouldn't want it to happen to you, now 
would you?  Enjoy the Crimson World, and may the Light shine 
upon you.
