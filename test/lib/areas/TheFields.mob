he is eyeing you.  He has blood all over his hands from the others who have 
dared enter his beloved fields.  He just wonders why you're here, and ponders on
what he should do with you.'

Can you believe what you see?  This man has an aura of death around him yet
you know who he is.  This is Onkara, the legendary priest of the damned.
He is a walking spirit that still roams this place.  He eyes you like that
of a king seeing one of his peasants toil for the first time.  He smirks
and comes over to help you.  He tries to speak to you but every time you 
see his mouth move all there is is more silence.  He turns away frustrated
about this.  Should you help him or kill him?

&wAn &Wangel&w, banished from &Wheaven &Bcries&w here, all alone&n.
~
  The wings on this man are huge to say the least.  There is fresh blood upon
his lips.  He was banished from the heavens for drinking the blood of the other
angels.  Although they might be dead they did have a human form.  He is very
large in stature as well.  He turns towards you with his sword and gets ready
to bleed you for his next feast.
