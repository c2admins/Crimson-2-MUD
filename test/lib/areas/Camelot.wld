The Drawbridge~
You stand at the entrance to the legendary city of Camelot.  A drawbridge
over a massive moat impedes your journey forward.  In the distance you can
hear trumpets heralding the arrival of important guests and you wonder who 
is visiting this splendid city.  Thoughts and images of the legend of Camelot
and King Arthur seep into your brain and settle like a fine mist, moistening
all of the dark spaces.  You feel lighter of soul just standing
before the great entranceway to this magnificent place.

The City Gates~
At the gates you can see the people of town bustling around and 
many knights floating around keeping an eye on things, and every
so often you can even see a knight of the legendary round table
walking about on quests of their own to be sure things run smoothly
in the town.  You almost feel it's a dream to be here, for you 
don't see anyone with even a concerned look, no one in rags, or
anyone even close to poverty.  Everyone bustles about with a very
content look about them doing daily chores.  You can only imagine
what it must be like inside, or to even live here.

this beautiful town.  You look around and notice that the architecture
is elegant and flawless, and you wonder how anything could be more perfect
until you glance upwards to gaze upon the castle of Camelot.  It is more
splendid than you could have ever imagined, and you feel drawn to seek out
the visionary who created such a magnificent place.

himself started this shop as a study for him, and to teach apprentices
but these days he spends most of his days studying in the castle
where it's much quieter.  His apprentices then decided to open the
study as a shop to buy magical items, and to learn to use them.
Looking around, you don't see anything special about the building.

that gives the entire castle a luminescent glow, and fills a weary
traveler with a feeling of warmth.  The walls of the keep are covered 
with beautiful tapestries, each depicting scenes and battles from 
from the lives of King Arthur and his noble knights.  Each tapestry
is a work of art, shot with strands of silver and gold, and obviously
a labor of love.

It is furnished with candles, parchments and books of a 
magical nature.  The air in this wing seems to smell of magic 
and all things that are timeless.

The West Wing~
You walk into the west wing of the castle.  It's a large room with
a high domed ceiling and large picturesque windows everywhere.  There
are a lot of plants along the walls of the room and doors leading 
off in every direction to various meeting rooms.  The only door open
is the room to the north.

The Main Hallway~
The arched roof of this hallway seems to stretch up to heaven itself.
Bright sunshine filters down through the large stained glass 
windows set into the ceiling, touching on the faces of the people 
walking by, and appears to create halos on the heads of the citizens
of Camelot.  There appears to be a crowd of people waiting to seek 
an audience with King Arthur to the north.

The Audience Chamber~
This a room of immense proportions, built to house the many people 
seeking an audience with King Arthur.  Set into the north end of 
the room is a large window, over looking the land of Camelot.  
Looking out the window a beautiful lake that glows with a strange 
light can be seen towards the northeast.

The Throne Room~
The throne room of Camelot's castle is one of elegance and beauty.
Sunlight pours from the high ceiling windows and gathers to pool in 
a sea of bright light illuminating King Arthur's throne.  The 
throne itself is plain except for a few odd markings that could
easily be mistaken for scratches and it looks small compared to
the large man seated in it.

The Round Room~
You walk into a stolid plain round room.  No pictures, no artwork
of any kind.  All you see is a large round table in the center of the
room.  In the center of the table you see an ever burning flame.
You feel almost intimidated being in the room of the legendary round table.
In here are a few more of the Knights, also discussing the impending
attack from the Saxons.  As you walk in they give you an uneasy
glance, and start to walk over to you.

You walk into a rather large meeting room, also known as the war room.
Pacing around the room are several Knights, discussing what to do about
the impending attack of the Saxons.  About the room are various 
paintings depicting the battles of the Knights which got them to where
they are today, including a picture of a young lad pulling a glowing
sword from a large stone in a forest as many lords and knights looked
on, jaws dropped in astonishment. You see this rather large painting
on the north side of the room.

An eerie mist fills the laboratory of the grand wizard Merlin.
Large shelves cover the walls of this room, each filled with
vials of strange smells, books on alchemy, and candles that
flicker with strange lights.  Merlin, the Grand Wizard of
Camelot, leans over a large crystal ball, eyes closed, chanting
in a language that sounds foreign to the ear.

Sir Lancelot himself here giving lessons to some of the royal guards. 
Watching the guards fight, you wouldn't think they needed training
until you see Lancelot go against them, at which point they seem to
be bumbling fools.  Lancelot grins at you and bids you join to see
if you could be any challenge to him.
