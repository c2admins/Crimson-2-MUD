E
tree~
This enourmous tree must be a thousand years old.  Its rough bark looks grey
and pale and is decorated with scratches and clawmarks.  On its west side is a
small opening just above ground level.

E
opening~
The opening is far too narrow for you to squeeze through but it looks as if the
tree is hollow.

E
branch~
It is very heavy and looks as if it has been dropped from great height.  It is
long and straight and the wood is very hard, still being full of sap.  Although
it does not fit very well in your hand, it could be used as a clumsy but very
heavy weapon.
