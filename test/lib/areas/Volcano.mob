Queen Xyria~
Queen Xyria is here waiting for someone to bring here a fresh corpse.
~
   This is a rather small dragon only about 9 feet tall.  Although small she is
not one to be reckoned with, her powers go far beyond normal dragon fighting.
She seem quite normal for a dragon, except for the fact her mouth is dripping
blood.  Just watch here closely, should could attack and you not notice.

Something big is blocking the window....wonder what this is?
~
   At first you thought this was a giant stone pillar, but now that you look
way way up you see that it is really a enormous dragon standing about 20 feet
tall.  It's claws and mouth are dripping blood and you see from the corpse
splattered all over the floor beneath you why.  He is big, strong, and wise...
And feels the need for.....&rBLOOD&n!

mob duskflame ancient red dragon~
&KDusk&rF&Rl&Ya&Rm&re&n~
&KDusk&rF&Rl&Ya&Rm&re&n is here, swimming in his pool of lava.
~
  Duskflame was once one of the mightiest red dragons in all the realm. His ferociousness
was exceeded only by his greed, however, and a rumor of great treasures led him to this volcano.
He did eventually find this treasure he was looking for, but by then he had grown too large from
feeding on the people of the city to leave. Now he resides here, forever trapped..waiting for a chance 
to escape.
