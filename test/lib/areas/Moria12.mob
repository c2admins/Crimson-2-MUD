the remains of victims found throughout the mines. At his side is sheathed
a glowing blade which is the symbol of his power and office. Though normally
a very aggressive species, he is the most willing of the mine inhabitants to
accept allies due to the losses he has suffered against the orcs. Even though
he is not as aggressive as the other leaders, he should still not be trusted
for he would assuredly stab any ally in the back once he gets what he wants.

more than make up for their small stature with pure ferocity. In times of need
their sharp pointy teeth serve as good weapons, while their large bulbous
eyes and huge pointy ears serve well at detecting prey. Many people tend to
underestimate a kobold just because of its size..often to their own peril.
