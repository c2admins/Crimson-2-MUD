Giggle's room~
Accelerator's scream from tires that streak.
Cupe, with your women on, dashed out.
Run away from the shadows, shut the door.
You said, "I don't care where, just run.
Encounter is a highway junction by the time I saw the harbor
I now know that I'm in love.
Take me to summer side, you said you prefered gentleness than a kiss
Night on summer side, with an innocent look in your eye, of an adult.
Take me to summer side, you said,"I prefer a kiss to loneliness"
Night on summer side, And the way you looked it was of an adult.

light in this room.  Red and yellow clad monks funnel the visitors north
towards the great burning altar.

Temple Hallway~
   You have ventured further into the Shaolin temple.  The monks are more
numerous, and the great flaming altar is directly north of here.  A small
hallway leads off into the darkness to the west.  Loud chants of worship
come from the north.

Before the Altar~
   There are numerous monks here.  A high priest is blessing all who ventures
to the north.  Only a small handful of people dare venture into the flame
that is north.  Pictures of ancient battles adorn the walls.  A small hall
exits to the east.  The crowd is going back to Main Street, obviously,
they are not pure of heart.

The Altar~
   The altar of Buddha is surrounded by fighting monks of the Shaolin temple.
There are hundreds of people kneeling down before the altar.  You notice a
large wooden statue of Buddha standing here.  The eyes give off a strange
ambience.  In a loud voice, the statue bellows, "Infidel!"  The monks start
attacking.

   Disregarding the statue's warning, you have entered the sanctuary of the
god Buddha.  You burn as you look upon his holy body.  As your equipment
smoulders on you, a HUGE hand comes from the sky and crushs you into
oblivion.

   The smell of tofu is overwhelming here.  Since these monks are vegetarians
they have to eat tofu to get their protein.  A large table is in the center
of the room.  Otherwise, the room seems to be deserted.  It must not be
dinnertime yet.
