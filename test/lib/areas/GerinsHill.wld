&yJust Before &cGerin's Moat&n~
&yThe path you have taken has led you to what used to be a splendid moat. Now, it is overgrown with
&gweeds&y, &glilipads&y, and &gwater hyacinths&y.  The land below you is soppy and sinks several inches 
with each step you take in it.  If you were to move just a few feet to the east, then you would
surely be underwater, unless of course, you had a boat to sit in.  The air is thick and muggy
here, with a hint of marsh gas.&n

Gerin's Moat~
&cOnce splendid, and now unkept and disheveled, Gerin's moat was crossed once a year by many 
adventureres and nobodies alike, to enter the &ydouble-doors&c in the &yhill&c to the east.  All 
who crossed came for one thing only: the great contest.  But now, Gerin has not called for a
start to his contest.  Maybe the old mage has died and all his riches might be left in his tower
on top of the hill.&n

Tall grass and weeds spring up from the water here.  Fish and snakes
swim and slither about.  To the north there seems to be some sort of 
clearing. Perhaps the moat will go around to the other side of the
hill if you follow it to the north (and perhaps not).
Through the trees and various plants to the east, you can just make out
the ending of the moat and the beginning of Gerin's Hill.

evident from the excessively large lair of white, creamy eggs to the
side. The way to the north looks impossible to breach because the the
thick foliage and overgrown undergrowth.

except maybe for looters.  You wonder if the looters are winners from previous
contests. They would already know there way around then.  But no, you now
remember that no winner of the contest ever came back a second time.  You
think that the award was so great that they must have moved to Elmpatris,
where life is good.

You step foot on the firm ground that is the base of Gerin's Hill.  It
was here that for several years, parties of adventureres made their
first footfalls in the short march up to the double-doors to the north
east. One million gold coins was the usual prize to 'winners' of Gerin's
contest. That and a magical item or two.  But Gerin has not called
his contest this year, and by the condition of the moat, rumors have
spread that the old mage has died.  And if Gerin is dead, then what
riches and treasures lay unattended in his Tower?

The hill is overgrown with trees and bushes here, but through the foliage
you can make out the shadowy form of Gerin's Tower perched high on top of
Gerin's hill.  It suddenly becomes obvious to you why people haven't climbed
up to the tower directly.  First of all, there doesn't appear to be any
doors, only one window at the Tower's peak.  And secondly, there is a 50'
vertical drop to the part of the hill the tower is resting on to the next
level of the hill.

You feel like you have been sucked into something against your will.
Certainly this doesn't feel like a cave.  Actually it kind of feels like
a church, the ceilings are high and the halls are wide.  Every footstep
makes an echo.  Both east and south are long and large hallways.  At 
the end of the east hallway, a door is cleary visible.  To the north,

Gerin's tower, and of course they want to get there first!

The Gazer's Collection Room~
Statuesque representations of humans, dwarves, cave crickets and other
commonly found creatures of Gerin's Hill seem to litter this room.
Indeed, it is very hard to see in one direction for very long without
looking directly at a statue.  What is remarkable is that these statues
are very realistic and probably could be sold for small fortunes.  However,
this does not appear to be the work of a medusa, or other creature of
legend like that...

Inspecting a few statues you are amazed at the detail.  Yet the detail is
not perfect.  It appears as if the stone has had a small acid wash.
Suddenly another idea pops into your head...what if these statues were
created from a 'medusa' like thing, except that the 'victims' were
sprayed with acid before they were stoned!

The Third Hall~
You stand within a grand hallway, not that it is excessively large, but
rather that it just 'seems' splendid.  You can't put your finger on it.
Perhaps it is the smell in the air, perhaps it is the great stairway
that leads up and down from this room.  At any rate, the hallway is
nice, the stones are smooth, and the floor shines as if it has just been
mopped!

You have entered the Crossways, or the route that lets you go between

second hall may be accessed, and to the south the third hall may be 
accessed.

Basked in an assortment of multi-colored lights is a tall white cross.
A sun and a fish are carved directly in the centerpiece of the cross, per-
haps to honor the two great Gods of CrimsonWorld.  The light that makes
the cross appear to be immersed in colored water, eminates from the stained
glass window on the far wall.  Two pews are positioned to either side of
the cross and there appears to be a leaflet, or a sheet of paper sticking
out of one of the pew backs.

Where is that light coming from anyway?

Small Chaos Gate~
You have entered the room behind the stained glass window, and now you can
see what the source of illumination is.  A small planar gate has been opened
here, and light escapes in a steady rhythym from it.  Every now and then
shadows pass across the light and you know something is about to step
through. Planar gates are never natural, and never beneficient.  If only
there were some way to close this one.

trying to get through.  You look around you in horror and suddenly you feel

Tall moat grass starts to entwine itself about your body.  If you were a

You are now very deep within the watery depths of Gerin's moat.  You esti-

go back up if you are running out of air.  At any rate, you have finally
reached a clearing in the moat grass, not that you can see anything anway, but
all that slimy grass clinging to your body gave you a new definition of
claustrophobia. It seems as if you can go up, to the east, or down from
here.

organs are gone and bone prevails.  You know that in time, nothing will be
left save for the skeleton.  A strand of the man's hair floats passed your
face and you swat it away.  Death, you think, is even worse when you are
not allowed to rest, and the pirannas are still eating your flesh.

Maze's End~
You have reached the end of Gerin's Maze.  May you never get lost in there
again! To the west there is a large amount of mist.

Hall of Mist~
You are in a room full of some sort of magical mist.  It is impossible to 
see 3 inches past your eyes here.  Even though the mist clouds the room you
get the feeling that there is a passage to the north.  The mist settles on
your face in a cool dew.

way continues to both the north and south.  The mist settles in a wet dew

the hallway continues to both the north and south.  With all this mist, you

You are in a hall that is blanketed thick with mist.  It is impossible to 
see very far at all here, yet you detect that this is the hall's end.  You
know that Gerin didn't design this maze for it to just end like this. 
Perhaps you have missed something about this hallway...

Hall of Warriors~
You stand within a quiet hallway.  That walls are white and clean and do not
appear to have been disturbed.  A red carpet leads east down the hall, wel-
coming you to the door it stops at.  The door which is about 30' away, is
the only interesting thing in the hallway, other than the carpet perhaps.
The door is quite large and has a great deal of scratch marks on it.  There
is also, what appears to be, a note attached to its handle.

the ceiling.  In the center of the room, a large mat exists.  It is a 30'

The paintings are of the beautiful Demon Goddess Draythen.  She is shown here,

Room of Morgoth~
You have entered the room of Morgoth, the only body guard Gerin ever really
valued. Morgoth has a knack for resurrecting himself, and thus proved very
useful to Gerin on many occasions.  Besides Morgoth, the room appears to be
a comfortable and hospitable environment.  A training mat is in the far corner
of the room, and undoubtedly, Morgoth will fight you there.

The circular chamber you stand in is of a grand design, for a wizard at
least. A large canopied bed lies snuggled against a wall.  A long, plush velvet
couch, stands against the western wall of the chamber, along with a beauti-
fully crafted oak desk.  Next to the desk is a black leather chair, with oak
arm rests inlaid with ivory.  In the center of the room is a giant cauldron,
and an experiment table with several odd looking devices on it.
