&c  A strong current pulls everything to the east. At first, nothing can be seen in that 
direction to explain this strange phenomemon, but then a giant whirlpool becomes visible. The
vortex sucks up everything in sight, &Bfish&c, &wpeople&c, even the &ylargest ships&c are pulled to the 
center of the maelstrom, never to be seen again. You are just now on the edge of the swirling
waters, and may yet be able to escape to the north and west, but heading further into the 
whirlpool will spell certain doom.&n

vortex sucks up everything in sight, &Bfish&c, &wpeople&c, even the &ylargest ships&c are pulled to the

waters, and may yet be able to escape to the north, but heading further into the whirlpool will

&c  Deep blue waters stretch as far as the eye can see. The plane of the water is broken by
the occasional &wdolphin&c or &Kwhale&c, but for the most part the waters remain calm and
lifeless. A brisk wind blows in from the east, good for sailing, but it is also very harsh
to those unaccustomed to the seas.&n

&cNearing the Edge of a Great Storm&n~
&K  Huge thunderclouds&c form to the southeast, and large waves begin crashing against you 
almost as if the seas were trying to bar further progress in that direction. The storm seems to 
spring up from the bowels of the ocean itself, as &Bgreat swells&c and &Ylightning bolts&c threaten
to find you a watery grave. The only safe passages are to the north and west along the edge of
the storm.&n
