The Dressing Room~
You are in a white walled room.  A thought enters your brain telling you to
dress here.  There is an exit down to the reception of the Midgaard Inn
where you can rent a comfortable private room when you leave the game later.
There is a huge sign on the wall with a "YOU ARE HERE" arrow.

The Temple Of Midgaard~
You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing Gods, Giants and peasants.

Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
The open air temple leads through to the street on the northern side.

through this maze of passages until you reach the end, where you are
greeted with an old maniacal man giving you one of the most wicked
grins you have seen in your lifetime. You are beginning to doubt if you
truly want to embark on this quest you are about to receive. The old man
seems to read your thoughts as he cackles loudly as soon as you think
this.
