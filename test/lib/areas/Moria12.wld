Battle Scene~
  A great battle took place in this narrow tunnel. Several bodies of orcs 
and kobolds lay scattered about, the bodies already decaying from the moisture
that exists within these caverns. Closer examination of the bodies reveals 
brutal wounds that could only be caused by years of mutual hatred.

  As the tunnel opens into a larger cavern, the most predominate feature

number of sharp pointy spears can be seen sticking out from behind the 
bodies, but no forms are visible from here. The tunnel leads south into the 
cave opening, and north leads further into the mines.

Beyond the Barricade~
  Stepping over the unidentifiable corpses that attempt to block entry into
this sector of the mines, you are greeted by a large number of kobolds who
scamper around in a vain attempt to form a defensive wall in case you turn 
out to be aggressive. The cavern itself is rather large, spanning out into 
the darkness as far as the eye can see, the ceiling also being hidden in the
darkness. Shadowy outlines of what can only be living quarters can be seen 
further to the south, while small shacks that serve as guard houses lie
to the east and west.

purpose. The dark tunnel leads north and south, north seeming to be 
a bit wider than the southern exit.

rather than being a natural formation. No stalagmites nor stalagtites
exist here, but sounds of trickling water can be heard further on to 
the east.

Entrance to the Temple~
  A small crack in the wall leads to a set of stairs reaching up to
an ancient and mysterious looking temple. Though no light exists here,
a plethora of moss and fungus survive in the area, feeding off of an
unknown gelatin like substance that seems to ooze from the very walls.
The temple itself is dark and ominous, having several skeletal remains
heaped around it's base, some humaniod, others undistiguishable due
to age.
