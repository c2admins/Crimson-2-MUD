A Large Pathway Through the Forest~
A large mountain looms in the distance as you find a rather large
and well kept trail. The ground is rather moist here, almost as if
it had just finished raining. Several large footprints can be found 
in the mud, made by some huge humanoid creature judging by the shape
of the indentations.

&KThe inside of this building is rather disgusting to say the least.  Several
&wlarge cages&K line the walls, their doors shut but not locked as noone would
dare try to escape the &cstorm giants&K.  Two guards are posted at the main

Jotun's Bedroom~
A comfortable bearskin rug covers the floor, ending at a rather modest bed.
A large table serving as a desk sits near a window, stacks of peace treaties,
war declarations, trade routes and the like sitting on top of it. A painting
of a rather large storm giant identified as Hartkiller, Jotun's father, hangs
near his desk. Otherwise the room is empty.

&wHallway Leading to the Temple&n~
&KThis grand hallway leading to the temple is decorated with large &pmurals&K on
the walls depicting the histories of the &cstorm giants gods&K. Many of them are
quite life-like and at times it almost seems as if the gods watch you walk 
down the hall, leaving you feeling uneasy.&n

&wTemple of Iallanis&n~
&KSeveral large &wstone pillars&K hold up the ceiling of the temple, otherwise
the holy building seems empty save for a &wlarge statue&K in the back. Several
priests and priestesses wander around in holy contemplation, seemingly un-
aware of your presence.&n

&wTemple of Iallanis&n~
&KA &wlarge statue&K of a graceful giantess wearing a dress of flowers sits against
the wall of the room. Several &Wplates of offerings&K have been placed at the 
base, but none look of any interest being mainly made of food items. A few of
the priests are praying here, hoping that one day the great goddess Iallanis
will reunite all of the giant nations.&n

&YChambers of the Highpriestess Hild&n~
&KA &plarge canopy bed&K dominates the room, covered in lush blankets and fluffy down
pillows. Beautiful colored &Ptapestries&K decorate the othewise bare walls, giving
this room a pleasant glow. A &wsmall shrine&K dedicated to Iallanis sits in 
the corner, several &Ycandles&K surrounding it. The highpriestess lives better  
than most, but is still rather stoic.&n

&yTop of the Stairs&n~
&KThe stairs end at a small, rather bare hallway that holds the rooms that guests
of the giants use while on extended visits.  To the north, at the end of the
hall, can be seen two &ydoors&K, while the stairs down lead to the audience chamber
of &BJotun&K.&n

just for appearance purposes for the guests. To the north can be seen two

&yGuest Room&n~
&KFurnished to fit the needs of beings smaller than the giants, this room is
rather extravagant when compared to the rest of the manor. A &ylarge oaken bed&K
sits next to a matching &ywardrobe&K, while a finely crafted, colorful rug covers
the entire floor. A &ychest&K used for storing visitor's possessions sits at the
end of the bed, and judging from its contents, the room is currently being
used.&n
