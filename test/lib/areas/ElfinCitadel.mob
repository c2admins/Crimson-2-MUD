The Elfin King~
The Elfin King is standing here.
~
As you stand before the ruler of this citadel, you are overcome with awe
at the majesty and power possessed by the king.  The king is every inch
the image of a legend; from his wrinkled forehead to his pointed slippers.
Though he is a very kind and benevolent king, you don't want to see him
angry.  He obviously holds great power in this realm.
