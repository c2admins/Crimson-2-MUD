&BNearing DEATH in the Wirlpool&n~
&cThe currents in the water pick up here, and are quite strong.  Large swells 
smash into the side of your boat splashing water everywhere.  The currents 
seem to run circular and you soon realize that you are being sucked towards
the middle of a huge whirlpool.  There is no getting out now, the boat is just 
about to tip sending you flying to a watery grave.&n

&bA Watery Grave&n~
That wasn't very smart.
Instead of getting the hell out of that wirlpool while you had the chance, you 
had to go ahead and go down with your ship, oh how brave you are to stay on 
your ship till the very end.. Where has it got you?, no one knows you here, no 
legends will be made about you, no songs will be sung by bards in taverns 
across crimson of how brave you are.
The water overflows your boat overturn it in a matter of seconds.  You are 
thrown overboard, parted with all your possessions, you descend deep down 
the center of the wirlpool kicking and screaming.  The currents turn you over 
and over, not knowing which way is up you grab for anything solid...nothing.  
You come to a realisation that it wont be too long now........
