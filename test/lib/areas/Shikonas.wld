&YBack of Shikarnith Island Beach&n~
This small beach at the back of Shikarnith Island is small and sorrounded 
with green forest.  Smoke flows into the air from the native wood elf village

&BNearing DEATH in the Wirlpool&n~
&cThe currents in the water pick up here, and are quite strong.  Large swells 
smash into the side of your boat splashing water everywhere.  The currents 
seem to run circular and you soon realize that you are being sucked towards
the middle of a huge whirlpool.  There is no getting out now, the boat is just 
about to tip sending you flying to a watery grave.&n

&bA Watery Grave&n~
That wasn't very smart.
Instead of getting the hell out of that wirlpool while you had the chance, you 
had to go ahead and go down with your ship, oh how brave you are to stay on 
your ship till the very end.. Where has it got you?, no one knows you here, no 
legends will be made about you, no songs will be sung by bards in taverns 
across crimson of how brave you are.
The water overflows your boat overturn it in a matter of seconds.  You are 
thrown overboard, parted with all your possessions, you descend deep down 
the center of the wirlpool kicking and screaming.  The currents turn you over 
and over, not knowing which way is up you grab for anything solid...nothing.  
You come to a realisation that it wont be too long now........

You break out of the magical forest into a large clearing. In the center of the 
cleraing is some religeous shrine, a fountain with water pouring onto its 
base, then disapearing in a blinding magical light.  Small humanoids dance in 
the air above the shrine, acknowledging your arrival, but not showing any 
signs of being threatened.
