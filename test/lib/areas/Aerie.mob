   As is typical of most elves, Jerial is quite comely even in her advanced

Nation in order to form a peace treaty between her people and the giants. 
As of yet though, Kotun has not granted her an audience and she is growing 
quite impatient.

mob vorn ul'azzr drow~
&KVorn Ul'Azzr&W, the &cRenegade &wGuardian&n~
&KVorn Ul'Azzr&w stands here, guarding his lands from &revil&w.&n
~
     Here stands before you a proud and noble drow. At a young age
he was sent to the surface world, where he was raised by a kindly
druid. It was here that Vorn learned the arts of being a ranger, 
and once the old human passed from this life the drow remained
steadfast in the ways of the forest. During his many adventures as
a mortal he gained many friends, who like himself were outcasts 
from their respective societies. Near the end of their careers 
they all decided to build a city, Brimstone, where beings like 
themselves could lead respectable lives without fear. 
     Vorn stands over six feet tall, huge for a drow elf. His hair
is silver and tied into a braid that falls just past his shoulders.
Eyes of emerald green constantly scan the horizon for any danger.
He is lithe, but strong..not a person to be taken lightly.

     A strange creature to say the least, Archon is the living spirit of 
numerous animal creatures fused into one body. He is basically humanoid in 
appearance, his body covered in a thick fur that seems to change color with
but a thought. His head is a concoction of wolf, cat and some sort of unident-
ified bird. Large feathered wings sprout from his back, completing his rather
macabre look. Despite his gruesome appearance, Archon is a gentle creature 
by nature and only serves to protect the lands from evil.

     Standing nearly six feet tall at the shoulder, IceRain is the second 
largest of all the Kil'Ron Mor. She is the mate of MoonShadow and travels 
with him whereever he goes. Her fur is as white as pure snow, and where she
gets her name. Normally very shy and benevolent, she will defend herself and
her mate to the death if provoked.
