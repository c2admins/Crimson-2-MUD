Before you stands a wonderful sight.  &YA&Bd&Rr&Bi&Ya&n&Wn&Ga &Bis a semi-clad 
beauty from a distant land.  Her almond skin shimmers in the low light of the room,
while her eyes dart to and fro, assuring that every one of Mercy's whims are 
attended to.  
&YA&Bd&Rr&Bi&Ya&n&Wn&Ga &Bstands six feet tall, with long, dark hair spilling over
her shoulders and onto her breasts.  Her eyes are the most seductive creations
you have ever witnessed, while her hands, slowly caressing Mercy's body, taunt
you with untold pleasures and delights.

&WBalderdash&w, the &rM&Ra&rd &xJ&xe&xs&xt&xe&xr&w is here.&n
~
  Nobody knows where this poor creature came from, or what happened to drive him insane. He acts
harmless unless provoked, and thus has been allowed to live out his life for now. He is dressed in a 
tattered and torn jesters uniform, leading you to believe this was his former career, but the only person
that could tell you for sure stares back blankly with no emotion.
  Though he makes no threatening moves, he looks quite dexterous and carrys a set of small daggers in sheaths
on his body. He can probably defend himself quite well when the need arises.

The great dragon &WFr&wo&Wst&Cmo&cur&Cne&n stands before you in all his glory.&n
~
  Frostmourne is an ancient dragon who once lived within the Ironstar Mountains in Torindrel. Centuries
ago the dwarves of the ironstar clan and drove the dragon out, but not without severe casualties. The 
dragon spent the next several years ravaging the countryside near the Quel'Sith forest, until one day 
he faced his defeat at the hands of the Ranger, Vorn Ul'Azzr. For reasons unknown, the dragon has risen
once again, striking terror into the hearts of mortal men everywhere.

A womble is here, wombling free.
~
You see before you a curious looking creature. It is only about 18 inches tall
and is covered in short grey fur. It looks almost like a small teddy bear, but
has a long nose and small black shiny eyes. It is wearing a tartan cap and
waistcoat, and seems to be muttering to itself quietly as it waddles around,
collecting trash to take home.
