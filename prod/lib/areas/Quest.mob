A kickable Nocture is here, waiting for your boot.

You see before you a curious looking creature. It is only about 18 inches tall
and is covered in short grey fur. It looks almost like a small teddy bear, but
has a long nose and small black shiny eyes. It is wearing a tartan cap and
waistcoat, and seems to be muttering to itself quietly as it waddles around,
collecting trash to take home.
