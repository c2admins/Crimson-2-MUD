&wThe Entrance to the Temple of Salvation&n~
&WYou find yourself at a set of white marble steps that seem to go on forever.  As you peer up to the top of the 
staircase, you can barely make out the outline of a large church-like building.  It appears to be constructed
from the same white marble as the stairs, and emits a faint glow.  About halfway up the stairs two massive 
crosses stand tall.  This is a house of the holy.&n

&WLooking forward you are put in awe at the massive beauty that is The Temple of Salvation.  Stone carved figures
jump out at you, because the detail is so realistic.  Beautiful staind glass windows extend for hundreds of
feet.  And in front of you stands a mighty guardian.  It is apparent that if you want to enter this marvel,
you will have to go through him first.&n

&KThe Temple Graveyard&n~
&yIn this graveyard, all of the head stones are the exact same shape and size.  The symmetry is almost eerie.
The men burried here never advanced to the rank of High Priest or Cardinal, but they were still strongly
dedicated to the temple.  Who knows what kind of spirits could wonder this graveyard.&n
