collected in his long and succesful career. He is wearing a large black robe
which covers even his hands, and you cannot help but wonder what he is 
concealing beneath it.

mob billy mailman postal worker~
Mailman Billy~
Mailman Billy awaits your requests.
~
Bloodshot eyes and foam at the mouth give you great confidence that your mail
is being handled by only the best of postal workers in the land.  Billy rarely
twitches since the electric shock therapy and only rarely goes postal when
you make completely unreasonable requests such as your mail.  Besides, 
nobody is really sure where Billy's hands are when they're not giving out
the mail so any contact is best kept short and sweet.

Standing before you is the Questmaster of Midgaard. He stares wickedly at you
and cackles loudly. He wears nothing but simple robes, and these look to be on 
just to keep him warm in the cold months. A grin suddenly spreads across his
face, as if he is thinking of the many trials you will go through on this
quest of yours, and the trouble it will cause. He cackles one last time,
before focusing on you.
