heard about DragonRealm. King Bahamut grins and nods and says "One thing was
left out of the legends, no one may enter my castle unless they are pure of
heart." At that he waves a hand and the gold dragons walk toward you, weapons
drawn.

Mage's Observatory~
As you look around, you see a new meaning to observetory. Not only is it open
to the outside to study the stars, but there is a large mirror, split in parts
showing the entire castle. In here you find the mage's apprentice, along with
the mage himself, but in a different form from which you last encountered him.
