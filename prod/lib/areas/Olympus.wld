&yIsland of ancient Greece&n~
&w  After a treacherous journey across the great ocean you have found the ancient
island of Greece. As you look around you notice that the shoreline is littered with
the ships seemingly crushed by immense boulders. Peering to the east and west you see
nothing but shoreline for as far as the eye can see. The island itself seems to be
heavily covered in vegetation of all types. To the south is the ocean from which you
came and to the north you can make out a path overgrown by the vegetation.&n

 &wMaking your way through the overgrown plant life you notice that there is
of little interest here. Yet with such vegetation would wonder how it can be
so quiet. You can not make head or tails of this island. The only thing that
seems for sure is the pathway heads to the north.&n

seems to reach out to the heavens above. There is a trail that heads up
the base of the mountain. The moutain trail is very treacherous for with
every step you take rocks jut out from the surface. One mistep and down
the mountain you could tumble.&n

&wThe hidden &rforge&w of Hephaestus&n~
&wAfter making your way through the &rf&Ri&re&Rr&ry &Rl&Ya&Rv&Ya&w. You have stumbled onto the
forge of the legendary immortal blacksmith Hephaestus. He serves as the god of metal workers
all across the greek lands. As you look at him he seems a bit deformed wearing a metal face
mask to hide his face. His size is unbelievable even the largest of mortals are pale in
comparison to him. He wields a massive forged hammer and wears gauntlets on each of his
wrists.&n
