Beneath the Turning Point~
You have stepped down into a dark and evil world.  You can feel the evil
coming from the shady walls around, emanating in ever strengthening waves
to pull you down into its embrace.  You have two choices.  You may step
deeper into the vile world of Domoi Itaba or you may retreat back into the
light of the world above.
There appears to be something scratched into the stones near your shoulder.

Nearing the Danger Zone~
You have stepped into the tunnels of Domoi Itaba and with each step you take,
you come closer to the dangerous creatures which reside in this evil domain.
Once you cross over, you will be at risk until you once again emerge into the
light of day.  Make sure you have a light!

Those who have been lured in this far by the weak soldiers of higher levels
are faced with the true defenders of Itaba.  To go any deeper will surely
mean death to the weak though the rewards to the strong could be remarkable.
Can you face the challenge?  A shiver down your spine at the blind rustling
of the creatures moving around you in the dark tries your nerve and gives
you a deep urge to turn and flee before you are consumed.

The King's Throne~
The fearful King of the Itaba rests here.  You notice that none of the upper
nobility will come within reach of his throne.  In this society where the
strongest is the leader, any approach could be seen as a challenge.  Any
noble that is overly attached to their head won't come within swinging
distance.

Upper Court~
You have crossed over into the upper court where tension is a way of life.
All of the Itaba nobility have to watch their back all the time from all
quarters.  It is better to kill than to be killed and you are just as much     
of an enemy as any other.  Tread carefully and don't get caught up in the
politics of these creatures.

The Queen's Throne~
If you thought the king was daunting, the queen is downright scary.  Of all
the nobility, she stands head and shoulders above the rest.  Her powerful
aura keeps the nobles at bay far easier than that of the king.  Even the
king dares not venture too close for the queen rules this society and even
he would not want to anger the queen.
