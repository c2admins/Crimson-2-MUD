  This is Blight the Avatar of destruction he has been imprisioned in
in the dungeons of gargath for many moons. As his power grew so did his
yearning for control of the keep. A wonderous battle occured with the
Arch-Duke for the throne. In the end Gargath and his many mininoins 
over whelmed Blight. His punishment for such treachery was banishment
to the dungeons of gargath keep for all eternity. You notice a few things
about him. One he is wielding a massive axe of somekind and two that he
is shrouded by a cloak of darkness.
