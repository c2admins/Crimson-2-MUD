Archer's Sanctuary.~
You stand between the first and second city walls of Northern Arnath. This is 
the place where the legendary archers of Arnath placed themselves to shoot at
invading armies. As you look out the thin horizontal openning of the first cit
y wall, you see how this could be an effective defensive design. The horizonta
l slit allows the archers to shoot out at the enemy while protecting them from
enemy fire. The slits are also large enough to allow a spear or sword to be
thrust out at enemies with shields. You have heard that this sanctuary entends
all around the city, intersecting the tunnels under the Blue, Red, and White T
emples.

Archer's Sanctuary.~
You stand between the first and second city walls of Northern Arnath. This is 
the place where the legendary archers of Arnath placed themselves to shoot at
invading armies. As you look out the thin horizontal openning of the first cit
y wall, you see how this could be an effective defensive design. The horizonta
l slit allows the archers to shoot out at the enemy while protecting them from
enemy fire. The slits are also large enough to allow a spear or sword to be
thrust out at enemies with shields. You have heard that this sanctuary entends
all around the city, intersecting the tunnels under the Blue, Red, and White T
emples.
