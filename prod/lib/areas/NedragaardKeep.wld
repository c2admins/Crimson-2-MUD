&BThe Depths of the Moat&n~
&cYou dive under the dark waters and begin to swim towards the bottom of the moat. Its really 
cold down here and your lungs begin to burn with a lust for fresh air. You finally reach the 
bottom of the moat and begin to grope about in the mucky soil. Your hands brush over a smooth 
object that seems to be protruding from the ground.&n

The haven of the killer eels.~
You slowly wade into what you believed to be a reasonably calm area of the moat. You could have 
not been any further from the truth. Without warning the water about you erupts into a frenzy of 
small flailing bodies of what seems like hundreds of small eels. They wrap their electrically 
charged bodies about your desperately thrashing form and drag you down to the depths below. The
buzz of electricity fills your ears and the stench of burning flesh enters your nose. Your 
sizzling corpse drops to the ground and the last thing that your brain registers before it 
explodes is the bright glow of your hearts greatest desire coming from the room to the east.

You have entered what you gather to be the gardens of the old castle. It has long ago lost its 
beauty, and is now overgrown and quite sinister. The flowers seem to sneer at you with malice, 
and the vines snake around your legs causing you to stumble as you walk.

A sooty window stares out to the castle grounds. Light should be shining in through the window, 
but if it is, it fails to reach the ground. A small rodent skeleton crunches under your feet as
you step back avoiding a thread of cobweb floating for your face.

center of the room and the large painting that depicts a battle between two different elven 
tribes and a small window in the east wall.

Two guards would have once stood here. One of the left, and one on the right, protectors of what
is good and pure.They would have been tall proud men, with familys, perhaps children. Now thier 
bones are left to rot on the ground. You wonder if their wives died of grief, or if their
children survived the long cold winter after the great fire, or whether the wolves that you can 
hear howling came for them while they slept.

to suck your life.

The hallway comes to and end, with a door to the south. The wood of the door is burnt and 
cracked, like that of a log in a campfire. Perhaps whoever was behind this door did not get out
in time, dying, screaming, in pain, their body twisting and contorting, trying to escape the 
searing flames. Perhaps the fire let them survive, leaving them to lay on the floor, dying a 
horrible slow and painful death as they starved to death, chewing off their own tounge in a 
painful grasp for survival, hoping to live till their savior arrived. Perhaps long after the 
fire subsided, they welcomed death as a cold but comforting friend.

rotting corpse fouling the water. It must have drowned while trying to quench its thirst, or
perhaps it too saw death as the only way out.
