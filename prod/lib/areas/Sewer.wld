Entry to the Midgaard Sewer System.~
You are standing in a large, smelly sewer.  The sewer has been built of brick
and there is lichen thriving on it in the moistness.  A channel a few feet
wide passes through here, although it is narrow enough for you to jump without
fear of falling in.
A narrow set of steel rungs leads up to the city above.

A damp tunnel.~
The tunnel here seems to be getting deeper toward the east and the water's
surface continues unbroken for the short distance you can see.
Beneath your feet you can feel rocks and stones, but the water is up to your
knees, hiding the floor from view.

A damp tunnel.~
Your feet splash in a very shallow covering of water as you along the tunnel
here.  It looks as if the water continues east, the main tunnel running 
north-south.

It is not clear what has cut this tunnel out of the rock, but it is clear that
it is natural.  There are small stones and rocks scattered around, and against
one side you can see a number of small stalagmites beginning to grow.

You are in a rugged natural tunnel running east-west.  The ground is flooded 
to your ankles with cool water, which helps to hide the smaller rocks, making
passage along here more uncertain.

your ankles soothingly.  The tunnel continues east, and to the west opens onto
a small pool.

The floor dips a little as you move toward the corner, causing the water to rise
up to your chest.  The ceiling is  little higher here also, allowing you to stand
straight, however the rocky floor of the pool does little to assist you.

there are plenty of small rocks strewn over the floor, and hidden under the
water it is quite treacherous.  You can taste fresh air drifting in from above,
