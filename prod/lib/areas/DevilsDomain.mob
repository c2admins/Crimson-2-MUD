&wA once &WRoyal Knight &wstands here, forever enslaved by his victor, &rSoulravage&n.
~
&nYou peer deep into this mans eyes.  It tells a story of a once
triumphant warrior, who, in his prime went to kill off the evils
of this world.  He traveled far and wide, until finding himself
in a large open cave with a small dwarf with that of his same
beliefs.  The dwarf told of great stories of the monster within.
A beast so large, it would take ten men to even leave a scratch
upon its flesh.  This man walked deeper into the cave, attacking
the monster, and, his plans were spoiled.  He was forever 
enslaved in a deep cave hidden well within the domain.  Now,
when he hears his masters call, he comes to its aid.
