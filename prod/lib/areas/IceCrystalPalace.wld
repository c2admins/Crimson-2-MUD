Before the Ice Crystal Palace~
Before you stands the legendary Ice Crystal Palace.  Its huge walls tower over
you and force you to step back to admire the great artwork carved into it.
You feel a great evil and a great good coming from within.  Its wonders pull
you into its great halls.

Guard Post in the Ice Palace~
This is a great sentry post located near the entrance of the palace.  Its guards
watch over your every move looking for any evil actions.  One states to you
"Watch yourself while in the palace, the king does not like fighting in the
palace."  You seem to believe and fear those words.  You notice that the
guards are slowly pushing you off to the east.

living persons or not but you dare not test them.  The foyer opens up to the

Behind The Throne~
You are in the throne antechamber.  You notice a small hole leading down into
the depths below.  Screams can be heard from down there......Human screams.
You stick you head thru the hole to see where it is coming from.  A blast of
wind hits your face and treathens to throw you from your perch into the depths.
As you stand up a piece of the floor gives way and you stumble to regain your
balance.  You cannot and are throw feet first into the hole.  Your whole
life passes before your eyes...at the end you see only DEATH!!!!



At the last second you catch yourself and avoid falling to what would have been
your certain death.  You now must decide to go back to the throne room to the
south or risk going down in the hole.  The appeal of treasure is very great
But is the price going to be your DEATH????

is slimey and you see a small pile of bones in a corner.  The bones
are from rats that have been killed by this man for food.

from passing without the key or permission.  Also a guardian has been

Cave-In~
As you enter this room you know that it was a bad idea.  The walls in 
here are very flimsy.  The noise you make knocks off some stones on the
walls.  You feel that you should leave very fast.  As you look back the 
entrance into the next room gets closed in by a cave-in.  You
now know that death is your fate.  You can blame no-one but yourself
for you know it was very stupid not to look where you were going.
