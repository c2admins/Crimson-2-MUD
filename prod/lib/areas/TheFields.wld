&bEntrance to &rDamnation&n~
   This place was once that of a legendary cult.  They were the founders of
the Wicca religion.  They practiced it to a "T" following the rituals the
solstices and holidays.  Then the Messiah arose upon them.  His army of 
many dead warriors overcame the Wicca tribe and their leader, Onkara. 
They forced this place into a barren land that can only grow the corn. This
place is still haunted by the figures of these men that died.  The Priest
of the Worms led to their downfall.  He summoned Messiah to his chamber 
to watch the people commit in Messiah's words "Blasphemy!"  He watched their
unholy acts.  The disgust in his body forced him to release his rage upon
the helpless people of the land.  He destroyed every last occult member
but letting Onkara live through all of it, torturing him daily making the
LeechWorms feed upon his flesh.  Now all thats left of this tribe is the 
souls of the fallen that still haunt these grounds.  The monsters of this 
land will stop anything and everything from entering and destroying their
haunting grounds.  WATCH YOUR HEAD.

&bThe Chamber &Rof God's Keeper.&n~
&KThe walls have been scratched, the floor has been made into a pattern of old
runes and ancient lettering from a long dead language.  This man seems to be 
murmering them while he looks at you.  The floor begins to shift as he once
again turns to chanting some archaic language.  The world begins to swirl,
leaving you drained, and to think that's just the beggining of what this man could do to you.&n

&wThe &KC&woffi&Kn &wof &bDisease&n~
  &nThe room is adorned with the &rblood&n of other angels who have 
lost their lives unto God.  This is the last remaining angel of a 
fallen religion, his scabbed wings give him a grotesque feature 
in the dimly lit lair.  He starts muttering to himself, &K"All 
oppressors shall die, I will reign in blood, I will reign in fear, 
all that's left is to take their souls!"&n  He beings laughing 
manically.  He then glances upon you for the first time and 
begins staring blankly into your eyes..  &K"What are you doing 
here? How did you get here?  Don't you realize it's the time of 
the angels and you're not one?"&n  He lunges at you as if to say 
that you have entered the wrong angel's lair.  His soul begins 
shredding out of him, tearing a hole in him, his &Kblackened&n wings 
vanish, along with the rest of his body, it has covered his human 
form.  A large wailing sound envelopes your ears and you 
suddenly realize this angel is dying. The glow of his soul thus 
becomes a beam of &Kdark light, a dark soul,&n floating into 
nothingness.  His time on this &yearth&n was less then a millenia, 
but the destruction left in this angels path will always be 
remembered and he will always be revered and known as 
the Archangel.

adorns the walls like paintings.  As you look down, you see a large pile of
decaying bones, most likely, dismembered from their owner, and, eaten on 
the spot.  The beasts that lurk within here must be hungry, and you're their
next meal if you step inside the darkness they call, their home.

screams in agony as one of the tiny insects squirms down, into his eye, and 
begins eating a part of his brain.  What have you walked yourself into...

The tension in the air is thick.  You hear shattered screams and cries for help
You cant help the less fortunate, you have to save yourself from dying.
