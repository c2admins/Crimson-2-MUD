You stand before an imposing castle.  Instinctively you know your destiny
lies beyond the castle.  Unfortunately, the castle builders put this structure
right in way.  The forest and brush on both sides prevent your mearly walking
around it.  You'll have to pass through it!  The door into the castle is
impressive.
