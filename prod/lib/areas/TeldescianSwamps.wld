&yInside a Small Shack&n~
  &gThis small hovel has obviously been here a long time as is made obvious by it's state of decay. The whole
of the building consists of this one room, which is spartanly furnished. A &ylarge wooden table&g dominates the 
the center of the room, upon which lie various bottles and containers with items best left undescribed. 
Several &yshelves&g line the walls, also filled with similar bottles, while a &ysmall cot&g lies in the back of the
room, covered by a single thin blanket. From the various instruments laying about, this appears to be the home
of a witch, and it may be within your best interests to leave.&n

only about knee deep for a human. Many different forms of &Gplant life&c cover the area near the

&yThe Marsh Forest&n~
&y  Toadstools&g and a strange glowing &Gmoss&g cover the ground all about you. The presense of
water near the surface of the ground is evident, and it's best to watch your step in these

 &gTaking a brief moment to pause and look down, you are almost overcome with vertigo. In such a
short time you have traversed more than half of the tree, and any fall now would spell certain
doom. You can opt to take your chances and dive off the tree, hoping something on the ground 
will break your fall, or you can continue climbing to find what was making that laughter-like
sound above.&n

&yA Heavily Trodden Path&n~
  &gTracks, larger than a human, lead both east and west. The large amounts of &Gvegetation&g that once 
covered this trail have been piled into heaps along the sides, creating a &Gdense and tangled mass&g that 
would make it impossible to travel either south or north.&n

&yA Heavily Trodden Path&n~
  &gTracks, larger than a human, lead both east and west. A small, &ywooden structure&g lies to the north, half
covered in &Glarge vines&g. A small opening in the &Gvegetation&g can be seen to the south, but it is too &Kdark&g 
to see where it leads.&n

&yA Small Shack&n~
&y  The stench of rotting flesh permeates the air as the door to the shack opens. Corpses both humanoid and 
otherwise hang from the ceiling, all in various states of decay. This is where the trolls store the food for 
their tribe, and from the looks of things, they don't care much about sanitation.&n

&gA Small Hollow&n~
  &gThe thick &Gvegetation&g to the north parts to reveal a small, semi-enclosed area that seethes with evil. The
&ytrees&g that provide the protective canopy have been twisted and corrupted, and the ground is barren and 
devoid of all life. Several &Kshadows&g flit around, and the entire area is a bit creepy. There is a &Kdarkness&g 
to the south that seems to be where the evil power emanates from, but not even magical visions can pierce the
&Kdark&g to see what that evil might be.&n

&BOn A Shallow River&n~
&cThe banks of the river are now completely consumed by &Gintense vegetation&c and &ymud&c.  The 
water itself appears to be coagulating into a jelatinous mixture... almost like &yclay&c.  What you 
had once thought to be &Cfish&c, you now fear maybe something much, much larger and more dangerous... &n

&gA Large Clearing&n~
  &gThe &ytrees&g have been removed from this area, creating a large clearing. Several &ytools&g lay scattered about in
disarray, leading you to believe the the construction of this area is not yet complete, and its purpose remains
a mystery.&n

&BA Large Stream&n~
&c  The stream here flows in a north to south direction. The banks
surrounding the water have become &ymuddy&c and slick with constant 
saturation. The water itself is not very deep, only coming up to 
your ankles, and is thus easily navigated. Further to the south the
waters appear to widen.&n

&BOn a Shallow River&n~
  &cThe bright and cheery features of the Quel'Sith begin to give way to a dark, overcast and
almost surreal landscape. A smell of &Ymold&c and &gmildew&c fills your nostrils as you begin to
pass what once were beautiful majestic trees, now dead and rotting near the waters edge. The 
waters take a sharp turn to the west, leading deeper into what is quickly becoming a swamp-like
territory.&n

&KThe Dragons Lair&n~
  &KA steep incline leads you out of the &ymuddy waters&K and into a dark, dry cavern. Numerous
&Wbones&K lay scattered about, and it becomes apparent that this is the lair of a dragon. Judging
from the way the cavern has been ransacked and lack of desirable loot laying about, one could 
surmise that the dragon was slain long ago and the lair looted by those to killed him. Still, it
may be good to look around and see if they left anything valuable behind.....
