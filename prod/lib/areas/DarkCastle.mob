mob angel arch angel uriel~
&WUriel, Pillar of the &yTree &Wof Life&n~
&WThe &YLight &Wof God stands here, plotting the &KQueen of Death's demise.&n
~
&wThe name Uriel  literally means "Fire of God," "Flame of God,"  "Light of God," or even "Sun of God." Uriel can be identified with  Agni, Devic Lord of the mental plane--the plane of fire. Some accounts place the Archangel Uriel at the head of the third order or company of  angels.  Others identify Uriel as one of the Seven Spirits before the Throne.  Kabbalistic writings assign Uriel to the middle pillar of the Tree of Life, and specifically to the sephirah Malkuth, the Kingdom.  The Archangel Uriel personifies the Divine Fire that comes down from the 3rd Aspect of Deity--Universal Mind--penetrating each plane until It reaches the physical.  There, the Fire ignites the fusion in the center of the Sun, the fission at the center of the Earth, and the kundalini at the base of the spine. It creates worlds, universes, and life--which then await the quickening impulse of the 2nd Aspect to evolve and grow.&n

mob nergal king damned~
&KNergal, the King of the Underworld&n~
&KThe king of the underworld stands at your feet.&n
~
&KIn Mesopotamian religion, a secondary god of the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon. He was identified with Irra, the god of scorched earth and war, and with Meslamtaea. The city of Cuthah was the center of his cult.  In the 1st millennium BC he was described as a benefactor who hears prayers, restores the dead to life, and protects agriculture and flocks.  Later he was called a "destroying flame" and was depicted as a god of pestilence, hunger, and devastation. The other sphere of Nergal's power was the underworld, where he ruled as king and where the goddess Ereshkigal was his queen.&n

~
&wSon of Nanna and Ningal, god of the Sun and of Justice, Utu goes to the underworld at the end of every day and while there decrees the fate of the dead. When Inanna's huluppu tree is infested with unwelcome guests, he ignores her appeal for aid. He aided Dumuzi in his flight from the galla demons by helping him to transform into different creatures. He opened the "ablal" of the Underworld for Enkidu, to allow him to escape, at the behest of Enki. Through Enki's orders, he also brings water up from the earth in order to irrigate Dilmun, the garden paradise, the place where the sun rises. He is in charge of the 'Land of the Living' and, in sympathy for Gilgamesh, calls off the seven weather heroes who defend that land.&n

&wA deformed man stands here, he leans down to your ear and tells you a story- I was born with four perfect ears, and four perfect eyes.  I was born mature. There once was a time in which I called the great evil to battle.  She came. I unleashed my weapons, shooting her in the belly with my arrow.  It split her in two.  I slit her heart and watched the blood leak from her body.  The great evil was dead.  I stood there, feeling her power soak into my body.  A heavenly light shown down upon me, and Anu peered down at me.  I was made king of all of Babylonia for such a great deed.  I stayed as their king until my mortal body perished.  Now I roam the afterlife in search of that great evil in which I killed years ago.&n

&KThe lord of the tenth generation of Vampires rests here, shaking from hunger.&n
~
&KStanding tall and proud, a very old vampire sits here in his crypt.  Karu was amongst the tenth generation of vampires.   Dating back to the first vampire, Cain.  Karu is the tenth generation in which the vampire race went forth and gave  their immortality unto the masses.  Karu wields a very large blade in which he has slaughtered any attacker who has walked into his tomb.  Karu stands almost ten feet tall, and is very muscular.  His face has been mutilated and is very old.  His sunken eyes and the very pale, white skin that is his flesh stare at you.  He lifts a hand and you see upon it scars from various battles and rot from which the wounds have not healed.  The stench of this crypt is horrible.  The smell of rotted flesh, with a stagnant quality of air enters your nose as you choke upon the noxious odor.  He smiles at you. He has given up killing humans, for he is too old.  He has his minions bring him fresh blood in which he dines upon, and, in return he teaches
his minions how to hunt and feed in the proper manners, to prevent being captured and killed by the humans outside.&n
