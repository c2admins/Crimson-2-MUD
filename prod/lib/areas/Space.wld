Temple to the Eternal Lag.~

You fill our days with delay
And make the fun all go away
You dance upon our relief and joy
You treat our time like a junky toy

You slow us down and kill us fast
You kill our screens, we can't relax
You cause anger and bring on pain
And the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain

Oh cruel lag that makes me cry
Go away and don't tell me why
Move your ass, don't drag your feet
Your punk body I'd love to beat.

Lag, lag, go away
Go to hell and stay away
If you don't I'll make you pay
We'll reboot, that's A-Okay.

Deiis Board Room.~
This is a more relaxed, informal room than the rest of the board rooms of this
godly realm. There are long padded benches around the room, and the walls
have long, intricate and very exotic looking drapes hanging from them.

Paradise Cove~
A long swath of unspoilt golden sand stretches north and south into the
shimmering haze of the distant horizon. The sand is pleasantly warm to the 
touch having been heated under the tropical sun by day and only slightly
cooler to the touch as the sand nears the waters edge. Looking out 
across the clear blue, fish laden waters of the bay, a small sailing boat
can be seen anchored next to a natural rock jetty easily accessible by a
path which runs alongside the coast. Gazing inland a wooden shack offers
shelter from the midday sun and a place to rest and enjoy the serene
vista. Beyond the shack, an overgrown path winds its way into a light
forest where all manner of small animals can be seen to be feeding and
playing in the undergrowth.

Rawhead's Realm of Pus and Decaying Flesh.~
As you enter this gastly room your stomach begins to heave as the stench
from the decaying flesh wavers into your nostrils.  All around you
corpses swing back and forth in the breeze upon large meat hooks.  In
front of you sits an enormous pile of rotting flesh and decapitated
skulls.  Perched upon the top of the mound, Rawhead stands devouring a
putrid piece of some poor mortal's remains.  His gaze turns toward
you... pondering on what new meat has wandered into his grasp...

Forest Retreat.~
Passing through the door, you find yourself in a small clearing which is
surrounded on all sides by dense woodland lit by starlight filtering
through the branches of the taller trees. Near the centre of the clearing
a clear pool of water reflecting the moonlight sky lies nestled in between
rocks covered in a variety of forest flowers and vines. At the waters edge
a magnificient stag is drinking at the cool water, blissfully ignorant of
your presence. In the shadow of a tall oak is a small campfire with places
set for several visitors.

Shast's Canopy~
You have entered a secluded alcove high in the canopy of an ancient
forest. By the dim light filtering through the leaves above you, you
peer around shocked by the branches woven beneath your feet, making
up the floor of Shast's home. You are surrounded by the sounds of
the forest and the tempting fruits of the trees which bear you up.
Without noticing, you sink comfortably into your place here in this
small paradise. Here is the home that you never knew you left but
know you never want to leave again.

Upon the mountain, the Demon Chair
Gargoyles grinning, dancing there
Chaotic noises, imps galore
Devil's den and Demon's door
Darkness, Blackness

Immortal drinks up all the light
The nymphs get scared
The satyrs run
The demons smile
Draythen's come.

Some relaxing music is played on the background when you enter this room.
You can't see much, only the flickering of some candles... When your eyes 
addapt to the darkness, you vaguely see some guy sitting on the ground, 
smoking some dutch pleasures. You wonder what that furry thing is on his 
lag.... Must be his pet. For some reason you feel yourself suddenly very at 
ease here and you just wanna sit here, talk to that dutch guy and chill 
here the rest of your existance.

&c   No moon, or stars, or sun shine here.  Only an inky blackness exists
that seems to squeeze the very breath from your lungs.  This is where
Nightwynde spends his time, forever reminding himself of the darkness that
once was a part of his soul.  You can barely make out a large object in the
center of the area.  Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a desk made
of blackened cedar with a large tome on top of it. No other objects are
visible.&n

   A misty haze surrounds you, filling your body with warmth.  The
air, as you breath it in, has a pleasant taste.  A quiet, soothing
silence falls about your ears, but your mind is filled with gentle
music.  You feel as though your weight has been lifted off your
tired feet.  Far beyond in this comforting mist, you notice a faint
light, a glow of something unknown.  You feel drawn to it...

&rSoft Ecstasy&n~
   As you walk into the room, the first thing you notice is the large,
dominating bed. The four poster bed is draped in layers of soft, sheer
fabric that brings about a soothing, yet enticing feel. The next thing
you notice is the soft velvet that drapes the walls. The dark fabric,
embroidered with &rtiny red roses&B reflects on the persona of this room. All
around are candles, letting their soft light fill the room with calmness
and serenity. This is a room to sleep, relax, cuddle and love.&n

&K There is barely light enough to see in this dank room.  The walls themselves seem to
give off a bluish glow that is providing the only light.  Numerous tables run along the
walls that contain all manner of torture implements.  The stench of fecal matter, blood,
and death permeates the air and you feel like retching.

You cannot see any visible end to the room.  From further down the room you hear the screams
of the tortured souls that are imprisoned in this foul place and an icy chill runs down
your spine.

This isn't hell but it is the next closest thing.&n

This is a very damp cold room, from the feel of it, in the middle
of a mountain.  It's lit with torches, just bright enough to be
able to read the tomes that on the shelves that cover the crude
walls.

The air is damp, and you hear the trickling of water in the distance
even though there are no visible entrances or exits.  There is a 
large round table in the middle of the room, with a few tables around it

separating you from the men behind them. You feel relieved that you are still

in the room. Slung over the back of the chair you see the famed Peacemaker
that Clint uses to keep the peace in these parts.

You wander into a dark cave, where the only light eminates from a small
fire in the center of the cave.  Off in the distance of the caverns you can
hear many wolves wandering around keeping a close eye on you. You feel
safe for a time as the wolves keep their distance, only keeping a close 
eye on you. All around the cave are magical artifacts, such as staves
symbols, gems, stones, and spices where the God of the Wanderers, those
who wander the worlds searching for their purpose, belonging and destiny,
practices his clerical spells.

   The floor and walls of this room are coated in thick, red carpets. A large
heart-shaped bed, covered in silk sheets, has been placed in the exact
center. A hanging garden grows below a skylight, which nearly drapes into a
steamy jacuzzi below. The heavy smell of musk hangs in the air, while soft
music plays from a set of magic urns. You feel this might be a good time to
lie down and relax...

&SThe Clo&Sud T&Sop Vie&Sw o&Sf Crim&Ss&Son Mu&Sd 2&n~

&cYou are standing upon a floating platform, far above the lands of Crimson Mud 2, hidden.
&cSprawled beneath you lie all the territories that make Crimson a land of magic, power,
&cfantasy, grief and joy.  The richness, diversity and beauty alongside the desolation, the
&cunoriginality and the bizarre fills you with glee and mourning.  You see all, feel all.

&cHere you are safe to observe and ponder the depths of your feelings.  Is it wonderful?
&cIs it hideous?  Is it all you ever wanted, or all you ever sought to escape?  The truth
&clies in the obvious - &CCrimson is all these things.&n


&cSo really, the question you should ask yourself is this: &WCan you handle it?&c  The demands
&cof this world are multitudinous.  Nothing will ever be perfect, nothing will ever be as
&cfinished or complete as you like them.  And in all honesty, that is the way it should be.  For
&cif you attain a perfect balance, an orderly mud, you have sapped the souls and creativity of
&cthe people who play this game.  Sometimes the most outstanding diamonds are found with the
&ccruddiest dirt.  It is your job to find these diamonds.  To cut out the good and set it to
&ccontrast the bad.  Your glory, your future and your status as an immortal depends upon it.

&rMay you be strong in your efforts on Crimson Mud 2.&n
